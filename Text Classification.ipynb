If you have\\n10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns\\nbecause you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will\\nattempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time\\nslice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.\\n\\nHaving said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding\\nin calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of\\nthing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before\\nyou started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).\\nIt all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going\\nto see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all\\ndoing network things also...)\\n-- \\n       Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels\\n Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com\\n  BBS: (310) 314-3227 * FAX: (310) 314-3217 * Compuserve: GO QUARTERDECK\\n   Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!\\n\",\n",

Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \\nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \\ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \\nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I\\'m going to state it again here.\\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \\nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\\n\\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \\nper day).\\n\\n\\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \\n\\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\\n\\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\\n\\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \\nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \\nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \\nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\\n\\n\\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \\n\\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\\n\\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \\n\\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\\n\\n\\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\\n\\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \\n\\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\\n\\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \\nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \\noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \\nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \\nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \\nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \\nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \\n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \\nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \\nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \\nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \\nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \\nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \\nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \\nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \\nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \\nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \\nbefore supplementation.\\n\\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \\nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don\\'t know about \\nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \\nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \\nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \\nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \\nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \\nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \\ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \\nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \\nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \\nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \\nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \\nin urinary oxalate excretion.\\n\\n\\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\\n\\n\\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\\n\\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\\n\\n\\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \\n\\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\\n\\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\\n\\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \\nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \\nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \\nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \\nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn\\'t \\nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \\nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \\nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \\n\\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \\nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \\nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \\nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \\neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \\nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \\nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \\nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \\nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \\nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \\ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \\nformation should be given B6 supplements.\\n\\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \\nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \\ncalcium-oxalate.\\n\\n\\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \\npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest.

I can\\'t\\n: see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,\\n\\nre: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93\\n\\nThis article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2\\nor DOS apps not running under Windows.\\n\\nOne of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that\\ntheir RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost\\neveryone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)\\ndiscovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept\\nan incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry\\nerrors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or\\nFAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer\\nthan with the old 2400bps modem.\\n\\n\\nThere are three reasons for the problem:\\n\\n1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most\\n   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the\\n   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high\\n   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and\\n   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded\\n   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can\\'t.\\n\\n2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and\\n   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely\\n   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you\\n   are losing data, you may be advised that \"you need to upgrade to a\\n   16550\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance\\n   about this issue,  you\\'ll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the\\n   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve\\n   my own problem had never heard the term \"16550\" and many didn\\'t even\\n   know what a UART was.\\n\\n3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2\\'s do), or if you can upgrade\\n   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience\\n   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers\\n   don\\'t take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this\\n   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications\\n   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem\\n   by themselves.\\n\\nIf you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of\\nthe card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid\\noverrunning it; however, I wouldn\\'t want to bet that the card designers\\nwere that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem\\ncard.  Some modem cards don\\'t even have conventional UARTs, but if they\\nare to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.\\nUse MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.\\n\\n\\nThe Hardware Situation.\\n\\nThe UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250\\nor Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can\\'t replace\\nthem).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft\\ndiagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*\\nbringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from\\naccurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.\\n\\nThe Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with\\nconfigurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to\\n460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there\\'s no point in\\npushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access\\ncycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but\\nit is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,\\nsee National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.\\n\\nSo, what UART component do you have?\\n\\nTry to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM\\nboard or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can\\'t find a socketed component with\\nthe numbers \"8250\" or \"16450\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,\\nand you won\\'t be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE\\nyour VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket\\nCOM board.\\n\\nIf you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in\\nNs16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several\\nsuppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \"N\" chip is the normal 40-pin\\ndual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550\\nchips without the \"A\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).\\n\\nEarly Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those\\nof their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various\\nIC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states\\nsupport for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:\\nNational Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552\\nChips&Technology:       82C607\\nTexas Instruments:      t16c550a\\nSilicon Systems:        73M550\\nVLSI                    16C550\\nTurboCom warns about the pre-\"A\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,\\nsays that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70\\nsystems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).\\n\\nIf you DON\\'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you\\'ll need to buy an after-\\nmarket COM or multi-function board.

I only needed two serial ports,\\nand am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based\\n8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set\\nthe internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.\\n\\n\\nThe Software Situation\\n\\nSimply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun\\nproblems.  The standard MS serial drivers don\\'t take full advantage of the\\n16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1\\ndrivers have the following limitations:\\n - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.\\n - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt\\n   rate of 10x during uploads.\\n - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it\\'s easy for 2\\n   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).\\n - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.\\n   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1\\n   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would\\n   be effective.\\n - The API won\\'t accept rates above \"CBR_128000\".\\n - The API won\\'t let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even\\n   if it did, DOS programs that aren\\'t 16550-aware get little benefit\\n   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.\\n - They don\\'t allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.\\n - The BIOS doesn\\'t initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.\\n - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don\\'t provide port\\n   speed options above 19200 bps.\\n\\nThese problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may\\nor may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).\\nRumors suggest they \"may\" be solved in Windows \"4.0\".\\n\\nYou can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying\\na copy of \"TurboCom\", current version 1.2, from:\\n\\nBio-Engineering Research\\nPacific CommWare Division\\n180 Beacon Hill Lane\\nAshland  OR   97520-9701\\n(503) 482-2744 voice\\n(503) 482-2627 FAX\\n(503) 482-2633 BBS\\nMCImail:    344-5374\\nCompuServe: 71521,760\\n\\nPrice was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit\\ncards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom\\nbut as far as I know, they don\\'t stock it.  Bio is not a software company\\nper se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for\\nan in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a\\nmarket for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They\\nrecently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.\\n\\nI now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my\\ndatacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely\\nsee transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps\\nwhen linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.\\nUploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts\\nare still using antique UARTs and drivers.\\n\\nNote that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu\\nin Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets\\naround this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will\\nset the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the\\nWindows APIs and dialog boxes.\\n\\nI also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you\\ndo the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is\\nnot a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)\\nstandard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another\\n16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving\\nsystem or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough\\nto let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm\\nengineer has informed me that the 16550\\'s can\\'t really do CTS/RTS all\\nby itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above\\n115,200 may still be risky.\\n\\nEven with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still\\nexperience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and\\nserious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to\\nbuy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a\\n16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of\\nTurboCom, can be found in the Feb\\'93 issue of \"Windows Sources\" magazine.\\nI suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with\\nprocess priorities and time slices if you are a \"power user\" whose\\nthrashing system still runs into comm problems.\\n\\n\\nClosing Soapbox Comments\\n\\nThe state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across\\nthe computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,\\nthe job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be\\nassigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer\\ncompanies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years\\nbehind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation\\nvendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the\\ninitial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was\\nsubsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the\\nexception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent\\nI/O.\\n\\nYou may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this\\nsituation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect\\ncries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \"sort of\"\\nwork today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a\\nhardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that\\nuse that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.\\n\\nRegards,                                          1001-A East Harmony Road\\nBob Niland                                        Suite 503\\nInternet:  rjn@csn.org                            Fort Collins CO 80525\\nCompuServe: 71044,2124                            (303) 223-5209\\n\\n                     Copyright 1993 Robert J.

However, the case and\\n  this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly.\\n\\nAs you can see, since this board includes drive controllers AND a video \\n  controller, you can save some money by buying this unit and not a MB\\n  where you would need to get IO cards, video card, and drive controllers\\n  Its just a lot more convenient on the whole\\n\\nI would like to ask about $500 for this whole package.  I think this is a fair\\n  price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllers/IO\\n  ports.  All you need to do is add drives, a monitor, RAM, and a keyboard. \\n  Also keep in mind that it isn't a generic board, but from CompuAdd.\\nI also will entertain all serious offers.\\n\\nPlease email at jmu@acpub.duke.edu\\n\\nThanks\\n\\n-J\\n\",\n",

There\\nis a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts\\nwithout active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really\\nbeautiful way to hear the Passion is it\\'s being chanted by three\\ndeacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants\\nin the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.\\nThis is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion\\nthat John would prefer.\\n\\nBut there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.\\nEach pastor makes his own decisions (it isn\\'t a church-wide conspiracy\\nagainst participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial\\nblessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already\\ngetting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they\\nshould not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the\\norchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation\\nin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation\\n--- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be\\nnecessary to go with the briefer options just to \"get \\'em in and get \\'em\\nout\".\\n\\nEach parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to\\ntheir geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish\\nin the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy\\ncloser to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow\\nparishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors\\ngenerally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though\\nyou probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly\\nto the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn\\'t follow\\nthe continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no\\nsingle one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated\\nequilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them,\\nthen the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering\\nthe names of the evolutionary theories.}\\n-- \\n                                                    --- Tim Rolfe\\n                                                 rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu\\n                                                 rolfe@junior.dsu.edu\\n                                                RolfeT@columbia.dsu.edu\\n',\n",

There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \\n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \\n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \\n          after the life of Jesus. \\n    \\n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \\n          world\\'s major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \\n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \\n          THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the \\n          teaching of REincarnation. \\n       \\n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \\n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \\n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \\n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \\n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \\n          UNIVERSES.)                             \\n\\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \\n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \\n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \\n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \\n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \\n      \\n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \\n          indicator for religious validity. \\n    \\n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \\n          other major world religions, including Islam. \\n     \\n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \\n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \\n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \\n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \\n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \\n          \"silver cord\". \\n    \\n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul\\'s cycles of \\n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \\n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \\n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \\n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \\n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \\n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \\n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \\n    \\n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \\n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \\n          Mat\" organization. \\n      \\n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \\n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \\n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \\n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \\n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \\n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \\n    \\n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \\n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \\n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \\n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \\n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \\n          classic. \\n    \\n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \\n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \\n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \\n          don\\'t ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \\n          Jesus was. \\n    \\n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \\n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \\n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \\n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \\n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n          \\n    \\n          RE-INCARNATION\\n          \\n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \\n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \\n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \\n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \\n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \\n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \\n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \\n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \\n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \\n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \\n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \\n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \\n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \\n          \\n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \\n          typically originate from a person\\'s PAST LIVES.  For example, \\n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \\n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \\n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \\n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \\n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \\n          INCARNATION. \\n\\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \\n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \\n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \\n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \\n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \\n\\n\\n\\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\\n\\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \\n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \\n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \\n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \\n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \\n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \\n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \\n          waiting for Jesus\\' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \\n    \\n          \\n          \\n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\\n\\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \\n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \\n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \\n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \\n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \\n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \\n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \\n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \\n    \\n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \\n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \\n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \\n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \\n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \\n    \\n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \\n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \\n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \\n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \\n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \\n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \\n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \\n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\\n\\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \\n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \\n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \\n       \\n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \\n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \\n          CONTINUE. \\n    \\n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \\n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \\n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \\n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \\n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \\n          a Member.

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\\n\\nMark proposed this design, which he calls \"Geode\" (\"rough on the\\noutside, but a gem on the inside\") or the \"ET Strongback with\\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge.\"  As you can see from file\\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\\n\\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\\nit can approach closer to the Station\\'s CG and at a structurally strong\\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\\ndocking system.\\n\\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\\nlaunch mass.  We\\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\\'ve never\\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\\n\\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\\'s life to perform a\\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\\ndid with Skylab).\\n\\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\\n\\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\\ndone to date.\\n\\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\\'s committee in Crystal City,\\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\\nseems more likely.\\n\\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\\'s design;\\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \\n\\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

Because of the\\nPalestinian\\'s popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -\\ncurrently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous\\nstatement: \"You look for me !\", i.e., I\\'am not making any more\\nefforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid\\'s point of view,\\nPalestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew\\nor the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the\\nPalestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly\\nMERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from\\nresidents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his\\ngovernment\\'s and his party\\'s lack of action for human rights and\\npeace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether\\nthey would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists\\'\\nperspective this is the best government because it is THEIR\\ngovernment, regardless of what it does.\\n\\nThese members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the\\nfuture of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to\\ndictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step\\ntowards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin\\'s\\ngovernment, and from their point of view the expulsions were a\\nmarginal byproduct of this \"government of peace\", which need not\\ndisturb the routine course of events. Likewise the \"Rabinic\"\\npolicies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets\\nand the significant increases in the number of persons injured in\\nthe suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.\\n\\nBut the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces\\nitself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has\\nlost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian\\nworkers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel\\nAviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing\\nto propose except separation: Let\\'s cut ourselves off from the\\nPalestinians, let\\'s build a fence so high that they won\\'t be able\\nto harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a\\nfence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.\\n\\nMeron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha\\'aretz (4-3-93): \"...The\\nliberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical\\nseparation and \\'the future of the territories\\', must come to\\nunderstand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab\\nworkers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement\\ndesigned for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that\\ntheir ideological support for separation only provides\\n\\'humanitarian\\' arguments for the legitimization of the <status\\nquo>.\\n\\nEnforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the\\nruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears\\nits burden. [.....].\\n\\n\"Whoover thinks that \\'out of Gaza first\\' is a liberal,\\nhumanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether\\nthis position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off\\nresponsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to\\nthus also disregard responsibility for it\\'s creation. It is very\\neasy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in\\nJerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at\\nthe disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue\\nall their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...\".\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n>From The OTHER Front, Jerusalem, 10 March 1993\\n\\n',\n",

I believe all of the\\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n|> \\n|>      Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\\n|> giving\\n|> \\n|> Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,\\n|> marginal.\\n|> \\n|> Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both\\n|> \\n|> shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.\\n|> \\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n|>      Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors\\n|> so\\n|> \\n|> liberally.

The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\\nthe possible votes.\\n\\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\\n\\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O.

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\\nSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that). I am not\\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\\n=====================================================\\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\\n=====================================================\\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\\n\\nONE OPTION\\t\\t\\t\\tANOTHER OPTION\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nNorthern Division\\t\\t\\tSouthern Division\\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\\t\\t\\tADIRONDACK\\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\\t\\t\\tSPRINGFIELD\\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\\t\\t\\tPROVIDENCE\\nCD ISLANDERS\\t\\t\\t\\tCDI\\nPORTLAND PIRATES\\t\\t\\tHERSHEY\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBINGHAMTON\\nSouthern Division\\t\\t\\tROCHESTER\\nHERSHEY BEARS\\t\\t\\t\\tHAMILTON\\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\\t\\t\\tUTICA\\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\\t\\t\\tAtlantic Division\\nUTICA (?)

I\\'m very busy and don\\'t have time to chit-\\nchat with you!\"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to\\ncall on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I \\nthen asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he\\nhad more time.  He responded, \"Just spit it out now because no time is\\na good time.\"  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and\\ntried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my\\nnervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered\\nand then said \"well, never mind\" and he said he\\'ll talk to various\\ncolleagues about other medications and he\\'ll call me some other time.\\n\\nThis doctor called me that evening and said because I didn\\'t express\\nmyself well, he was confused about what I wanted.

He told\\nme that he just doesn\\'t have time to \"rap with patients\" and thought\\nthat was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to\\n\"rap\" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through\\non his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he \\nfelt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his\\npatients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me\\nthis apology: \"I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you\\nmistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you\\nbut I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don\\'t have a lot of\\ntime to deal with that.\"  He then told me to call him the next day\\nfor further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.\\n\\nI am still upset and have not yet called.\\n\\nMy questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care?\\n(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to\\nbe more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive?\\nIf this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type\\nof pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but\\nnow I am afraid to call him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t--Marlena\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor\\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\\'s founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\\'s Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT\\'s \\nX11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit\\nuses Xsi.\\n\\nOur toolkit manages each character\\'s size based on our own font management system.\\nIn order to do that, the \\'wchar_t\\' typed character strings must be decomposed\\nto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with \\nASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t\\narray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout\\nand application environment\\'s locale. In this case if the locale is \\'japanese\\',\\neach wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.\\n\\nWe need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters\\nfrom the top are the same character set and what the character set is.\\n\\nWe could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used\\nXsi\\'s internal functions to construct that function. The following is the\\nsource code of that function \\'decomposeCharacterSet()\\'.\\n\\n\\n//I18N.h\\n// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-\\n// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $\\n\\n#ifndef _I18N_H\\n#define _I18N_H\\n\\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\\n\\nextern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,\\t/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t int wc_len,\\t\\t/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t char *buf,\\t\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t int *buflen,\\t\\t/* IN/OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t int *scanned_len,\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t char **charset);\\t/* OUT */\\nextern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str);\\nextern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);\\n\\n#endif /* _I18N_H */\\n\\n//I18N.cc\\n/* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */\\n\\n#include <stdlib.h>\\n#include <X11/Xlibint.h>\\n#include <Xm/Xm.h>\\n#include \"I18N.h\"\\n\\nextern \"C\" {\\n#include <X11/wchar.h>\\n#define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\\n#define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs\\n#define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid\\n#include \"Xlocaleint.h\"\\n#undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\\n#undef _Xmbfscs\\n#undef _Xmbctidtocsid\\n    extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t char*, int*, int*, int*);\\n    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);\\n    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);\\n};\\n\\nint decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t  int wc_len,\\t\\t/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t  char *buf,\\t\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t  int *buf_len,\\t\\t/* IN/OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t  int *scanned_len,\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t  char **charset)\\t/* OUT */\\n{\\n    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();\\n    int ctid;\\n    int status;\\n    Charset *xcharset;\\n    \\n    status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);\\n    if (status == Success) {\\n\\txcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));\\n\\t*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;\\n    }\\n    else\\n\\t*charset = NULL;\\n    return status;\\n}\\n----------------\\n\\nAn included file above, \"Xlocaleint.h\", is also Xsi internal and we copied\\nthe file to the toolkit directory and compiled.\\n\\nA serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on\\nour HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.\\n\\nWhen we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,\\nlink errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:\\n    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)\\n    _Xmbfscs (code)\\n    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)\\n    _XFallBackConvert (code)\\n\\nWe had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until\\nHP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that\\nbecause HP did not release HP\\'s X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to \\nknow how HP\\'s R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi\\'s popularity and used \\nits internal functions. \\n\\nThe HP\\'s linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.\\nWe observe from HP\\'s libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are\\nnot sure if they used MIT\\'s vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and\\ntherefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT\\'s Ximp for Xsi does not\\nseem to lead us a solution.\\n\\nMy question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like\\n\\'decomposeCharacterset()\\' listed above. Is there any function to check\\ncharacter set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales?\\nIf it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we\\nwant to use any internal functions in HP\\'s X11R5 as we did for MIT\\'s R5.\\n\\nIn order to render a \\'wchar_t\\' type string, there must be some machinery\\nto judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for\\nthe string. We have no way to find out that without any HP\\'s X11R5 source \\nfiles. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. \\nAny help or comments would be highly appreciated.\\n\\nI also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area\\neven if it is not HP\\'s implementation.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n--\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTakeshi Inoue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinoue@crd.yokogawa.co.jp\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYokogawa Electric Corporation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOpen Systems Laboratory\\t0422(52)5557\\n',\n",

The sad truth is: sometimes that is\\ngood, or at least, better than the alternative.\\n\\n>But let\\'s ignore guns for defence and/or crime and look at gun accidents.\\n\\nOk.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the\\nnumber has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these\\naccidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.\\n\\n...\\n>But seriously: a gun is designed to fire a bullet.

It certainly isn\\'t\\nwhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,\\nand might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to\\nkill people.\\n\\n>This is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show\\n>someone  that you have a gun and they go \"Gee, perhaps I should leave\".\\n\\nIn fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses\\nof firearms don\\'t involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer\\nnot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what\\nyou say when you point a gun at them.\\n\\nIf you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to\\nimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is\\nabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work\\nthe best.[3]\\n\\n>No, you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human\\n>body and hurt them.  Not a tough concept to swallow, for most.\\n\\nCertainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)\\naren\\'t deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn\\'t true to say that all of\\nthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with\\nhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to\\nuse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,\\nbut my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and\\nknowing how to use the tools to do that.\\n\\n\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear\\narms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in\\ngovernment.\"\\n\\t- T.

It is\\nvery rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \"get-pissed\" and kill\\nsomeone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long\\nhistories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these\\npeople wouldn\\'t kill if they didn\\'t have a gun, feel free to present it.\\n\\n>Having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to\\n>kill things.  Right?\\n\\nRight, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I\\nnever have to shoot a person, but I\\'ve had to kill a number of animals from\\nrodents to cows, and when I do, I don\\'t want them to suffer any more than\\nis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them\\nto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,\\nI don\\'t want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and\\nammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I\\'m\\nafter, but it doesn\\'t always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,\\npeople who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,\\nparticularly handguns, haven\\'t used them much for that purpose.\\n\\n\\n[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:\\n\\t48700 deaths by auto\\n\\t11300 deaths by fall\\n\\t 5300 deaths by drowning\\n\\t 4800 deaths by fire\\n\\t 4400 deaths by poison\\n\\t 3200 deaths by food\\n\\t 1400 deaths by firearm\\n\\n     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.\\n     \"Accidents Facts 1988 Edition\".

Radio Atmospheric Science Center.\\nIn International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program.\\nHandbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 p\\nPublication Date: Jun. 1986\\n      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere \\ntroposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar \\nfeatures an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large \\nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \\nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \\nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \\nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \\nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \\ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \\nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \\nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \\nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \\nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \\ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \\nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \\nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \\nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \\nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \\nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \\nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \\nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \\nand results are discussed.\\n\\n\\nEquatorial radar system\\nFUKAO, SHOICHIRO;  TSUDA, TOSHITAKA; SATO, TORU; KATO, SUSUMU\\n(Kyoto University, Uji, Japan)\\n(COSPAR, IAGA, SCOSTEP, et al., Plenary Meeting, 27th,\\nWorkshops and Symposium on the Earth's Middle Atmosphere,\\nEspoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research\\n(ISSN 0273-1177), vol. 10, no. 10, 1990, p. 151-154.\\n     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent \\nscatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 \\nkm altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in \\nPontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The \\nsystem is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array \\nconfiguration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been \\nin successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about \\n3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective \\nantenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of \\nthe MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam \\nsteering within 20 deg from the zenith.

The indication from Rick is that they may\\n#  certainly be.\\n\\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \"official doctrine\"\\nis obviously very important.  McConkie\\'s views have been controversial\\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\\nas \"McConkie\\'s Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley\\'s books!\\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

I received 20\\nresponses and 4 requests for summary. Thanks to everyone who made it\\npossible.\\n\\nOn my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebase\\nand Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application\\nthat can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL\\nstring and receive the results.\\n\\nMost people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other \\nproducts mentioned were: Microsoft\\'s ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase,\\nRBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.\\n\\nFor myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C\\nportability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the\\nsource code, and portability is important in my application. It works\\nwith DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.\\n\\nHowever, I feel that Microsoft\\'s ODBC looks very promising.\\nIt\\'s mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and\\nformatting query results. As the responses say, it\\'s available via ftp,\\nexcept it\\'s effectively unusuable without two manuals:\\nthe \"ODBC Programmer\\'s Reference\" and the \"ODBC SDK Guide\". Moreover,\\nODBC doesn\\'t actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that\\'s \\nup to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also,\\nit\\'s Windows only (it\\'s actually an extension to the Windows SDK). \\nNevertheless, it\\'s a start at a SQL interface standard, and should\\nmake life interesting in the future.\\n\\nHere\\'s my original post, followed by the responses, separated by \\na line of asterisks (*).\\n\\n> Does anyone know if Borland or Microsoft have libraries for accessing\\n> their respective databases (Paradox, FoxPro) from within C programs?\\n> I\\'d really like to be able to build a SQL query string and pass it\\n> to a function which returns the query results in some format.

Overacker) writes:\\n\\n   You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I\\'m not trying to be\\n   contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\\n   stood by the Pope.\\n\\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\\ndisobeyed.\\n\\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don\\'t view the\\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\\n\\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\\n   authority and discipline.  \\n\\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\\nbishops.  It\\'s basically the Reformation part II.\\n\\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\\nhour, probably.\\n\\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I\\'m reading a book\\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\\n\\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\\n\\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer\\'s\\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\\n\\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\\n\\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\\n\\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\\n\\n\\t Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\\n\\t could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\\n\\t the Pope\\'s position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\\n\\t don\\'t jointly make such  choice.)\\n\\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\\n   If I adopt the view that \"I\\'m NOT wrong, I CAN\\'T be wrong, and\\n   there\\'s NO WAY I\\'ll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\\n   I\\'ve either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\\n\\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn\\'t go along with it is an\\ninstant non-Catholic.\\n\\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\\ndoing, they would be shocked!\\n\\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\\ndoctrine is.\\n\\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\\n   I may be wrong here, I\\'m not Roman Catholic. :-)\\n\\nThat\\'s heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\\nspread that it\\'s pitiful.\\n\\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\\nfact, that\\'s what usually happens during a major heresy: large\\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\\nrun.\\n\\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\\n   Again, I\\'m not trying to be contentions, I\\'m trying to understand.\\n   Since I\\'m Orthodox, I\\'ve got no real vested interest in the outcome,\\n   one way or the other.\\n\\nYes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what\\nis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of\\nthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic\\nschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for\\nthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?\\n\\n   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\\n   Pope\\'s commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\\n\\nNot really; start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last\\n300 years.  Everything is very well spelled out.  The West excels at\\ncritical thought, remember?  That\\'s what Catholic theologians have\\nbeen busy at for centuries.\\n',\n",

Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\\nescapes me at the moment) called \"Homosexuals in History\" asserts that Roehm\\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm\\'s SA circle.\\n\\n>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,\\n>were homosexual.

If you don\\'t believe the history books,\\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \"knight of the\\nlong knives\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA\\'s\\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I\\'ve \\nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \\n\\n>(Irving, a\\n>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance\\n>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)\\n\\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \\nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \\nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don\\'t you think they \\nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \\nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \\n\\n>I challenge anyone to document this claim.\\n\\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\\n\\n>I *have* found a great\\n>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the\\n>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,\\n>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.\\n\\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\\n\\nI don\\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\\'s friends\\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \\nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\\'s homosexuality.\\n\\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \\npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \\nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \\nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \\nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \\nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \\nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don\\'t have the time. Nothing is\\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove\\notherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.\\n                                                                           \\n/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\nDavid Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)\\n\"...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softly\\nof us in days hereafter...\" (Ezra Pound)\\n/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\n',\n",

       " 'From: alastair@farli.otago.ac.nz (Alastair Thomson)\\nSubject: Does \\'Just/justifiable War\\' exist?\\nOrganization: University of Otago\\nLines: 107\\n\\nHi there netters,\\nI have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on:\\nIs there such a thing as a \\'justifible\\' war? \\n\\nWhat I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: \"All war  \\nis wrong\", or \"Some war is justifiable\". \\n\\nTo get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the  \\nquestion. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  \\nZealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  \\nit, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  \\nThrough this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  \\nin the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  \\nhardware as the very best a \\'real\\' flyer could ask for. My favourite  \\ncomputer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  \\npast and present. \\n\\nI became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  \\nmilitary activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  \\nto God\\'s commandments to love one another, especially one\\'s enemies.\\n\\nDuring the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  \\nthe reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  \\ntechnology I so admire - The F117A \\'Stealh\\' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  \\nstrike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  \\nsimulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam\\'s  \\nbio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  \\nMig\\'s in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  \\ngame. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  \\nOne only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  \\nof war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  \\npilot is simply a \\'target\\'. Dead civilians are \\'collateral damage\\'. These  \\neuphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  \\nsupport are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  \\nlook at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.\\n\\nNow we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  \\nthe prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in  \\nthe former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  \\nSarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry \\'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  \\nhas caused me to rethink where I stand on \\'justifiable\\' war.\\n\\nI will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  \\n- Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  \\nreactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  \\nhistory brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  \\nmy reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I  \\nam working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.\\n\\n1. The Second World War\\n\\t- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.\\n\\t- Massive civilian casualties on both sides \\n\\t\\t- Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki\\n\\t- Probably justifiable.\\n\\n2. Korean war\\n\\t- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically\\n\\t  communism vs. capitalism.\\n\\t- Probably not justifiable.\\n\\n3. Vietnam\\n\\t- As above, worsened by US involvement.\\n\\n4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.\\n\\t- Genocide by Khmer Rouge.\\n\\t- Probably justifiable.\\n\\n5. Iraq (Desert Storm)\\n\\t- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply\\n\\t- Other factors such as genocide.\\n\\t- Not sure, but probably justifiable\\n\\n6. A future involvement in Bosnia\\n\\t- Genocide - so called \\'Ethnic Cleansing\\'\\n\\t- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.\\n\\t- Probably justifiable\\n\\n7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,  \\nsomewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya  \\nor Israel.\\n\\t- My feelings in this are simple\\n\\t- Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent\\n\\t- I love the New Zealand government\\'s stand on banning all nuclear\\n\\t  armed or powered warships from NZ port.\\n\\t- Never justifiable.\\n\\nThese are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I  \\nwould appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I  \\n*don\\'t* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).\\n\\nThanks for your help.\\n\\n==========================================================================\\n                                    |\\nAlastair Thomson,                   | Phone +64-3-479-8347\\nChief Programmer,                   | Fax   +64-3-479-8529\\nThe Black Albatross Porject,        |\\nUniversity of Otago,                |\\nDepartment of Computer Science,     | e-mail alastair@farli.otago.ac.nz\\nP.O.

Everything else is practically\\ndown in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any\\nnew problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --\\nthe actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,\\nyou *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns\\nand beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.\\n\\nThe major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for\\nmore than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.\\nFor what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop\\na new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper\\nmight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less\\nambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)

That was the first order of business, \\nbut it was both.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In the President\\'s mind, are they linked \\npolitically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the \\nstimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to \\nthe American people?

MYERS:  He\\'s discussing options with him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over \\nthe break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they \\nhad earlier for the package, the stimulus package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'ll let you draw your own conclusions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any \\nother Republicans again today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s nothing specifically scheduled, but \\nagain, I wouldn\\'t rule it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to \\nany other states today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  What we\\'ve done is we\\'re in the process of \\nbreaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I \\nthink it\\'s entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those \\nup, we\\'ll send out press releases to the various states that suggest \\nhow their states would benefit from this package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will you share those with us?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And \\nwe certainly can continue to provide them today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, since yesterday\\'s questions and subsequent \\nstories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has \\nbeen given?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing\\'s changed since yesterday.  I think \\nthe President commented on it this morning to say only that it was \\nsomething he knew was being considered by the task force and that he \\nhas not made a decision on, and I don\\'t think we have anything to add \\nto that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But he also said that business and labor groups are \\ntelling him they support it.  Can you tell us --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I\\'m not going \\nto speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that \\nthere has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don\\'t \\nthink he said he was directly contacted by them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are we to take that to mean that the administration \\nhas sounded out business and labor groups on this --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think there\\'s been plenty of public \\ndiscourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don\\'t think \\nI want to add to that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In February, though, the President said that this \\nwas something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What \\nhas happened between then and now to cause this administration to \\nchange its mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is \\nsomething that the working groups are looking at.  They\\'re \\nconsidering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to \\nspecific options that will be covered by the President\\'s health care \\nplan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision \\non it.  And beyond that, I don\\'t have anything to add.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You haven\\'t answered the question.  It wasn\\'t being \\nconsidered by anyone in the White House after the President\\'s \\ncomments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then suddenly --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What happened?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said \\nthroughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options \\nacross-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about \\nand that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added \\ntax.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But the President himself took this off the table, \\nDee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility \\nof this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it \\nhasn\\'t been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are \\nlooking at it, as they\\'re looking at a wide variety of options, and \\nno decisions have been made.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  And it raises the question of how independently the \\ntask force is working.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider \\nall options, and they\\'ve taken that mandate seriously and they\\'re \\nconsidering all options.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But that\\'s not the impression that the President \\nleft in February.  The impression he left was that this was something \\nthat was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The \\nclear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was \\nnot on the table, not an option. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  \"If it changes I\\'ll tell you.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Bring him on.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  And you repeatedly referred to the President\\'s \\nremarks, telling us that those were still in operation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But that\\'s what Alice Rivlin\\'s comments and Donna \\nShalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an \\norchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers \\n--\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn\\'t -- no, Alice Rivlin\\'s not a \\nCabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not \\norchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last \\ncouple of days that it\\'s something that\\'s being looked at.  We \\nconfirmed that yesterday.  And I don\\'t have anything to add to that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it because he has very few options?\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon \\nthe task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has \\nthe President himself personally ruled it out and it\\'s now up to the \\ntask force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in \\nfact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with \\nthe President?  \\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group\\'s mission at \\nthis point to convince the President of anything.  It is their \\nmission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and \\nthe costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I \\nthink that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that \\ncontext, and at this point he\\'s not -- that presentation has not been \\nmade, but it\\'s something that he will hear and he has not made a \\ndecision on.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  They will present it to him as one of his options, \\nthough he specifically ruled it out?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is \\nthis a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to \\nthis form of taxation?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s simply a statement of fact.  The \\nworking groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number \\nof issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that \\nthey\\'re looking at is the VAT. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining \\nthis possibility, was this on the table during the same time period \\nthat you were telling us that it was not?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know what the specific timing of \\ntheir drafting of options is.  I don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Who was telling you that it was not under \\nconsideration?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President\\'s \\ncomments.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won\\'t raise \\nenough money to fund the core benefit package?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there\\'s no decisions that have been made \\non how to pay for the health care plan.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I\\'m asking whether the projections --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s a number of options depending on how \\nthe plan is structured.  You can\\'t decide how much the plan is going \\nto cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so \\nyou can\\'t discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out \\nuntil you know.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, we\\'ve been told that they have a computer \\nmodels on a number of possible packages.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is whether they have now determined \\nwhether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest \\nminimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we\\'re \\nnot going to answer until -- there\\'s a number of options being \\nconsidered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact \\ndetails of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for \\nthem are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And when the President has been meeting with health \\ncare -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     they have never once said to him, these are your \\nfunding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT \\nin his --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific \\nnature of the daily -- they\\'re not daily, but the quasi-regular \\nbriefings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, you have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he\\'s not \\nconsidered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, but you said that it has not been presented to \\nhim as an option.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That doesn\\'t mean he hasn\\'t heard about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to get into the details of \\nwhat\\'s discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn\\'t \\nlooked at it, do you mean that he hasn\\'t looked at it in terms of \\npaying for medical coverage, or hasn\\'t looked at it in general?  \\nBecause back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it \\nworks, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if \\nyou go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical \\ndiscussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were \\ngenerally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, \\nit\\'s something that he\\'s thought about in the broad context.  I mean, \\nthat was clear in Chilicothe.  What I\\'m saying is that in the process \\nof the working groups it\\'s something that he hasn\\'t considered yet.  \\nIt\\'s something that the working groups will present to him among the \\nnumber of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I\\'m not \\ngoing to comment any further on the details of the meetings where \\nhealth care issues are being discussed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s your statement from this podium that no \\ndiscussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that \\nthe option has not been presented to him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  That is correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand \\nby George\\'s statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have \\nnothing to add to what\\'s already been said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin \\nsaid yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or \\nconsidered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made \\nso that it would be less regressive?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to comment any further on what \\nmight happen if.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But do you stand by the previous conversations in \\nFebruary that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said \\nyou\\'d exclude food and energy --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to comment on the specific \\nstructure of a decision that hasn\\'t been made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala\\'s \\ncomments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working \\ngroups?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know specifically what --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you check for us, because that\\'s a real \\nimportant credibility question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since the task force was brought together this \\nissue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one \\nfairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in \\nthe dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month \\nand a half when you\\'ve been denying that a VAT tax would be \\nconsidered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we\\'ve said all that we have to say.  \\nIt is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has \\nnot made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to \\nadd.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of \\nquestions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem \\nwith credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we\\'re asking is, if \\nyou all were not told at all that this thing was being considered \\nwhile you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if \\nit\\'s a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading \\nus.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe that anyone has ever come \\nout here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to \\nindicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'re not trying to shade answers or \\ndeliberately mislead anybody.  I\\'ve said what I have to say about \\nthis issue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  All we were trying to find out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you\\'re trying to find out \\nand I\\'ve given you the answers, Helen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We\\'re trying to find out what changed -- what made \\nit an option again.  That\\'s the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \\nmandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but it wasn\\'t an option before.  How can you \\ninvestigate it if the President has taken it off the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they\\'re obviously \\nconsidering and the President has not made a decision on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They\\'ll \\npresent it to the President at some point and he\\'ll make a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off \\nthe table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s clearly on the table. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change \\nhis mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s back on the table, Bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did he change his mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn\\'t made a \\ndecision about it.  He obviously knows that it\\'s on the table.  It\\'s \\nsomething that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on \\nthis we\\'ll let you know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So he must have changed his mind, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, there\\'s like two options -- either he \\nchanged his mind or the working groups think they\\'re authority \\nexceeds the President\\'s.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \\nmandate to look at all options; they\\'ve done that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you going to put out his income tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on \\nhis income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be \\navailable. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through \\nit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing\\'s planned.  I think someone will \\nbe available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you \\nthrough the questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We\\'re used to be walked line-by-line through the \\npresidential tax forms.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'ve seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could we have one?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:   No, I don\\'t think there will be any kind of \\na formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer \\nyour questions about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they file a joint form?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When did he file it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it\\'s being filed today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for \\nMiyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the \\nmeeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No backgrounder today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We can\\'t give you taxes and Miyazawa all in \\none day, it\\'s too confusing.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of \\nforce in Bosnia.   They\\'ve both said that, A, they never ruled it \\nout, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your \\nthinking on whether or not to change your approach?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s been no change in our policy towards \\nBosnia.  We have always said that we\\'d consider --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they \\npeople whose opinions would carry weight with you?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  They\\'re people whose opinions carry weight \\ncertainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they\\'ve \\ninitiated.  But there\\'s been no change in our policy for Bosnia, \\nalthough we\\'re considering a number of options right now.  If the \\nSerbs don\\'t come back to the negotiating table, if they don\\'t sign on \\nto some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, \\nwhich we\\'ve been saying regularly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a \\nstraight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not \\nset a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or \\ntactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'re continuing to put pressure on them \\nevery day.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Which doesn\\'t work so --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  \\nWe\\'re going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we \\nsupport the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on \\nthe 26th.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You say it\\'s having an effect -- can you give us \\nany documentation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'d be happy to provide somebody to talk to \\nyou about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There\\'s been no -- you have not been able to \\nprovide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any \\neffect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they\\'ve had effect in Serbia \\nand we think they\\'ve had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I\\'ll be \\nhappy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if \\nyou\\'d like.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We would like to hear from someone who can show us \\nwhat the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of \\nthe terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven\\'t \\nseen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you \\nprovide something along those lines?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced \\nthis morning -- where is that money coming from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'ll have to work with Congress on the \\ndetails of that package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So that would be new money that you would hope to \\nget?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:    Yes, that\\'s new money, in addition to the \\n$1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have \\nseen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in \\nTokyo by Secretary Christopher.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t there a concern, though, about offering \\nsomething which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the \\nconcern with Vancouver; you didn\\'t want to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do \\nsomething immediately, which required money that was already approved \\nin the Fiscal \\'93 budget.  What we\\'re looking at now is a little bit \\nlonger-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we \\nannounced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional \\napproval, or some of it will anyway, and we\\'re going to continue to \\nwork with Congress to make that happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by \\nCongress?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of \\nconversations with members and will continue to work with them as \\nthis process moves forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a \\nfair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through \\nCongress?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with \\nCongress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is \\nthat -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and \\nthe law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President\\'s jobs \\npackage.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help \\ngive kids something to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who are they?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s members or leadership from three \\norganizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police \\nOrganizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police \\nOrganizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union \\nof Police Associations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will the FBI chief be there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these \\nnational law enforcement organization leaders.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the \\n$400 million that\\'s in the FY \\'94 budget for disarmament?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So this would be the $700 million that\\'s in the \\nbudget already, plus another $1.1 billion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 \\nmillion already in the budget.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or \\nFiscal \\'94 --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'ll work with Congress on the exact \\nfunding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This $1.8 billion on top of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 \\nmillion Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob \\nDole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was \\ncalling Bob Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting \\nwith Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some \\nRepublicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are \\ncomplaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House \\nand the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the \\nother night, the satellite and all of this relationship.\\nDoes the White House feel that you\\'re getting too close to these \\nChambers of Commerce?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  That\\'s an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)  \\nAfter how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any \\nattention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of \\nbeing too close.  I think that\\'s interesting.  But no, we\\'re thrilled \\nby the support we\\'ve received from the national Chamber and local \\nChambers across the country and we\\'ll continue to work with them on \\nthis and other initiatives.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the status of the President thinking about \\ngoing to this Democratic retreat?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s on his calendar.  I think he\\'ll almost \\ncertainly go.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  All three days?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We haven\\'t figured out exactly when he\\'ll be \\nthere yet.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it open to coverage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he going to have any kind of address, statement, \\nanything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'re still looking at that.  We haven\\'t \\nmade a final decision about how we\\'ll -- who will make a statement or \\nwhat --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn\\'t rule it \\nout.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about an AIDS czar?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s coming.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Anything on the weekend?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There\\'s been a suggestion that he\\'s going to this \\nretreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear \\nor have any involvement in the gay rights march.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n        2. X terminals\\n        3. NeXT\\n        4. Silicon Graphics\\n        5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\t6. Other stuff\\n\\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'ve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\\n\\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you\\'re going to have a hard time finding\\n\\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\\n\\truns the X window system, you\\'re in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\\n\\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\\n\\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\\n\\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\\n\\n\\tThe two main programs I\\'ve found to do this are KT and A2X.\\n\\n\\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\\n\\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\\n\\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\\n\\tserver can do this, run \\'xdpyinfo\\' and see if any of these strings\\n\\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn\\'t have this,\\n\\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\\n\\tor bugging your vendor.\\n\\n\\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\\n\\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven\\'t seen it.\\n\\n\\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\\n\\n    2. X terminals\\n\\n\\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\\n\\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\\n\\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\\n\\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\\n\\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\\n\\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\\n\\n    3. NeXT\\n\\n\\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\\n\\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\\n\\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\\n\\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\\n\\n    4. Silicon Graphics\\n\\n\\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\\n\\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don\\'t\\n\\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It\\'s not\\n\\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\\n\\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\\n\\tdetails.\\n\\n    5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\n\\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\\n\\tUnfortunately, you can\\'t just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\\n\\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\\n\\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\\n\\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\\n\\tworks.  However, they don\\'t want me to redistribute it.  I\\'ve been  ||\\n\\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\\n\\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\\t\\t\\t\\t    ||\\n    \\n    6. Other stuff\\n\\n\\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\\n\\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\\n\\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\\n\\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\\n\\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\\n\\tluck.  Contact the companies for more details.\\n\\n\\nApple Adjustable Keyboard\\n    Apple Computer, Inc.\\n    Sales offices all over the place.\\n\\n    Availability: February, 1993\\n    Price: $219\\n    Supports: Mac only\\n\\n    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.

And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\\n\\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\\n\\nA little research lent support to Brocki\\'s opinion of Professor Copperud\\'s\\nexpertise.\\n\\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\\n\\nHe\\'s on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\\nWebster\\'s Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud\\'s\\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\\nof the Association of American Publisher\\'s Humanities Award.\\n\\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\\n\\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\\nthe following letter:\\n\\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\\n\\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being\\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\\nsentence, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\\nfree State\\', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, \\'the\\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\\noath to support, if necessary.\"\\n\\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\\nthen concluded:\\n\\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\\n\\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"The words \\'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\\nsecurity of a free state,\\' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying \\'militia,\\' which is\\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject \\'the right\\', verb\\n\\'shall\\').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\\nmaintaining a militia.\\n\\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\\nand bear arms solely to \\'a well-regulated militia\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\\nto a right of the people.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is \\'the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\' granted\\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\\nthat such right \\'shall not be infringed\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\\nexisting, is the statement \\'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\\nshall not be infringed\\' null and void?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\\nto the security of a free State,\\' grant a right to the government to place\\nconditions on the \\'right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\' or is such\\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\\nmilitia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase \\'well-regulated\\nmilitia\\' mean: \\'well-equipped\\', \\'well-organized,\\' \\'well-drilled,\\'\\n\\'well-educated,\\' or \\'subject to regulations of a superior authority\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means \\'subject to regulations of a superior\\nauthority;\\' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\\ncontrol over the military.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.\\'\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"As a \\'scientific control\\' on this analysis, I would also\\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\\nAmendment to the following sentence,\\n\\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\\ninfringed.\\'\\n\\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\\n\\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment\\'s sentence?;\\nand\\n\\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict \\'the right of the people\\nto keep and read Books\\' _only_ to \\'a well-educated electorate\\' -- for\\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your \\'scientific control\\' sentence precisely parallels the\\namendment in grammatical structure.\\n\\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\\n\\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\\nany conclusion.\"\\n\\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\\nprotects the people\\'s right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\\n\\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\\nold guard\\'s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\\n\\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\\n\\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\\n\\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn\\'t mean what it says it means but\\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\\n\\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\\n\\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\\ncredited.

And I don\\'t know\\nabout you, but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the\\nspirit.  If you don\\'t give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they\\nwill never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!\\n\\nWhen we minister in my small group, I encourage people to speak out any\\nimpressions or images they think might be from the Lord.

I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but\\nclearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have\\nnever heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the\\nLord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are\\nmature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow\\nbelievers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging\\nprophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed\\n-- but God is not silent!\\n\\n>Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new\\n>but rather an inspired translation of scripture.

All of this is pretty risky\\nstuff in a PC environment.\\n\\n>The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to \\n>fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows\\n>and a few other things.\\n\\nA reasonably accurate prediction...\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s a brief description of how DOS stores files:\\n\\nThere are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain,\\nand the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined\\nnotebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.\\n\\nThe directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,\\nand first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that\\'s not\\nimportant right now.\\n\\nThe File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find\\nthe actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the\\nnumber is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it\\nholds a \"magic\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad\\n(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster\\ncontains the next section of the file.\\n\\nThe data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.\\nThe data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is\\ndoled out in \"chunks\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster\\nis 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.\\n\\nTo read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the\\nstarting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.\\nNext, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will\\ntell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.\\nNaturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump\\naround and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a\\ntime, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker\\nwhich says it\\'s the last cluster in the file.\\n\\nCHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of\\nthe directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into\\nsubmission.  It doesn\\'t have any intelligence, so you have to\\ndouble-check anything it \"fixes\".\\n\\nNow let\\'s do a bit of a post-mortem:\\n\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\CVPIC.EXE\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\VPIC.TXT\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\VIDEO7.CFG\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\ORCPRO2.CFG\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\VGA.CFG\\n>C:\\\\GAME\\\\GOOSE\\\\BIRD2.X\\n>C:\\\\WINMISC\\\\ADV21\\\\WINADV.EXE\\n>   Allocation error, size adjusted\\n\\nAll of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don\\'t match\\nthe size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter\\nthe directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the\\ndirectory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.\\nBut CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,\\nobviously, are made up.))\\n\\n>   316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains.\\n>    647168 bytes disk space would be freed\\n\\nDisk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached\\nto any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these\\n\"lost chains\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK\\nthrough FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell\\nCHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply\\nbe marked \"available\" in the FAT.\\n\\n\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\CVPIC.EXE\\n>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133\\n\\n...\\n\\n>C:\\\\386SPART.PAR\\n>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133\\n\\nThese files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,\\none of them (at least) must be wrong.  It\\'s interesting to note that\\nC:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...\\n\\nTo fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.\\nThis will \"fix\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.\\nNow delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to\\nassemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \"Missing pieces\" are\\nlikely to be found in those \"lost chains\" at the top...)\\n\\n>  42366976 bytes total disk space\\n>   3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files\\n>    153600 bytes in 67 directories\\n>  36042752 bytes in 1496 user files\\n>   1564672 bytes available on disk\\n\\nYour disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of\\nthe problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an\\namount which exceeded available disk space...\\n\\nIn any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.\\nThere are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage\\nafter something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the\\nproblem occurs.

I\\'d\\nlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to\\nuse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation\\nconsoles date from the early 60\\'s and don\\'t provide this function.\\n\\nWe already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,\\nand our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control\\ncircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the\\ncue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there\\'s one\\nproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be\\na sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,\\nso to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid\\ncuetape!)\\n\\nIdeally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.\\n(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)\\nThis would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.\\nWhat I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay\\nfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay\\nis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit\\nof some sort.  I\\'m sure some of you already have the solution figured\\nout in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!\\n\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nMark Fontana\\n\\n-- \\n \"Of all the arts, the cinema is  |  Mark A.

A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is\\nderived deterministically from this serial number. That means that\\nthere are only one billion possible unit keys.\\n\\n   To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\n   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\n   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n   64-bit block R1:\\n\\n\\t   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\n   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\n   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n\\n\\t   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n\\t   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\n   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\n   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\n   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\n   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\n   agencies.\\n\\nHmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial\\nnumber N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2\\nis an intentional way of assuring a \"fail safe\" for the government --\\nU is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not\\nchange they constitute effective \"master keys\" (along with F), the\\ntheft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)\\ncompletely obviates the security of the system. However, more\\ninterestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no\\nmatter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1\\nand U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space\\nif it NOT to provide an additional back door?\\n\\nI find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on\\napproximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on\\nthe back of a napkin.\\n\\nEven if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this\\nrestriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is\\nassuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the\\ngoal is an illusion of security.\\n\\nIf S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if\\nthey can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number\\npairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one\\nunderstands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,\\nsoon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via\\nespionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well\\n-- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but\\nby the time we know it may be too late.\\n\\n   As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\n   written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\n   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\n   U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\n   disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n   2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\\n   After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\\n   vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\\n   assurance that no information is left behind.\\n\\nNone of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of\\n\"destroying the laptop\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.\\nWe all know that you can\\'t read data from DRAM that has been turned\\noff for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don\\'t know\\nis why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the\\nfirst place other than to weaken the system. We don\\'t know if the\\nagents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their\\ninformation -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make\\nthe bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing\\nthis in a \"vault\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room\\nwith a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make\\nhigh-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little\\nfor most of the rest of us.\\n\\n   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\n   room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\n   and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\n   the escrow agencies.\\n\\nWhat would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and\\nthe NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always\\nhonest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they\\nhave the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don\\'t need to\\nsteal they keys as they effectively already have them.\\n\\n--\\nPerry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com\\n--\\nLaissez faire, laissez passer.

I\\'ve\\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\\n     and the other theists alike.

I\\'ve\\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\\n     versa, I\\'ve known Christians who were once\\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I\\'ve even known\\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.  Once the child is able\\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\\n     of every day.

He stroked a line drive into the\\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\\n\\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\\n\\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \\nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\\nthe catch.\\n\\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \\nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\\nimpossible.\\n\\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\\nnine games.\\n\\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\\n\\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\\nof the fan.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nMark Singer    \\nmss@netcom.com\\n\",\n",

STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his \\nprogram should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we\\'re going to be \\nwilling to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to \\ncome up with, but I\\'m not going to get into figures right now.  Let\\'s \\nsee what happens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s reasonable to assume, isn\\'t it, from what has \\nhappened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order \\nto get a vote?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more \\nintrested in stopping progress on the President\\'s jobs bill, than in \\ndoing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the \\nRepublicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the \\nPresident\\'s jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, \\nreal jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there\\'s no \\nquestion about that.  There\\'s been some frustration of legislative \\nactivity over the last few days.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So, you\\'ll need to compromise to get your package \\nthrough?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'ll see what happens with the \\nconversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     prepared to compromise --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President\\'s prepared to listen \\nto what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting \\nwith Senator Dole. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he\\'s \\nbeen very successful so far in the beginning of his term.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record \\ntime, in six weeks, and it\\'s a budget which reduces the deficit by \\n$500 billion over five years.  And it\\'s a budget which provides for \\nimportant investments in our future.  Right now we\\'ve also had strong \\npassage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a \\nminority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock \\nand hold up action on the President\\'s jobs program is not a sign that \\nhe is not succeeding overall.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He can\\'t beat this, can he?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The fact is they can do that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop \\naction.  There\\'s no question about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What are you going to do about it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, what do you know about these alleged notes \\ntaken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears \\nthat the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that \\nwhen they say yes they mean no?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that\\'s a complete \\nmisreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the \\nconversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring \\nPresident Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime \\nMinister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister\\'s \\nbelief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  \\nI mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and \\netiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where \\nhe was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese \\nwere serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   Are you saying that the President said that when \\nthe Japanese say yes they mean no?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s not -- I don\\'t know the \\nexact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say \\nsomething along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime \\nMinister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the \\nJapanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and \\nthere appears to be --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'ve seen the reports in the \\nJapanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It \\ndoes talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of \\nview.  I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be a problem.  I believe that \\nthere may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up \\nbut I\\'m not positive.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, was the specific comment that was made \\nspecific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general \\nobservation on Japanese etiquette?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The specific comment is what I\\'m asking about that \\nhas alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \"when the \\nJapanese say yes they mean no.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean \\nI don\\'t think that\\'s the whole sentence.  I think that the specific \\ncomment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific \\nfinish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that \\nPrime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was he saying it facetiously first?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual \\nobservation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to \\nclear it up.  Has the President sent a message?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don\\'t think the President \\nspoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but \\nI\\'m not sure exactly how many.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you\\'re \\nmaking it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got \\nthe reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that \\nit was understood and make sure there was absolutely no \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the \\nSecretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure \\nthere is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don\\'t believe there is \\non.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they \\nmay have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese \\nis as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two \\ndays.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime \\nMinister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. \\nposition, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the \\nKuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa\\'s \\ncommitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a \\nconstructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to \\nhear that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq \\nfor the last few days, I\\'m a little confused.  What is the U.S. \\npolicy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s the same policy that Secretary \\nChristopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have \\nreiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance \\nwith all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, \\nSaddam can\\'t stay in office?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that\\'s -- our \\njudgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with \\nthe resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that \\nwe expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will \\ncontinue to demand it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And are you concerned the Iran will become the \\ndominant power in the area --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also \\nspoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect \\nfull Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping \\nsupport of terrorism.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s a very glib statement that he won\\'t stay in \\npower if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you \\nbase that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not \\ncomplying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the \\nrights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is \\nnot fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  \\nHe is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding \\narmaments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he \\nwould be out of power?\\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on \\nthe repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make \\nit more difficult for him to stay in power.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it \\nthat you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure \\npolitics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence \\ndo you have that they just don\\'t have a genuine idealogical \\ndifference with you that\\'s in good faith?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times \\nin the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the \\nfight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now \\nseek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate \\nRepublicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to \\nthem during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had \\none, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate \\nRepublicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and \\nthinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -\\n-\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I\\'m not sure that it\\'s true \\nthat there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the \\nRepublican leadership on at least two occasions before the \\nintroduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate \\nRepublican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are \\ncontinually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who \\nhave an interest in the President\\'s package.  We are interested in \\nwhat they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is \\nimportant, and we\\'re going to continue to fight for it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats \\nalone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it \\nthrough?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is \\nno question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can \\nfrustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  \\nYou only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going \\nand to stop any action, and that\\'s what the Republicans are doing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     going to rethink the way you attempt to get \\nother things passed as you go through this process for the rest of \\nthe summer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     work with Republicans and try to woo some \\nRepublicans into your camp?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'re going to continue to \\nlook for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the \\nPresident\\'s intiatives?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But on this one -- how are you going to do it \\ndifferently than you did it on this one because on this one you \\nreally did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear \\nthat it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and \\ncould get it through and you really didn\\'t need Republican votes?  \\nAre you going to take a different tack when you have to go for \\nparticular votes?  When you have to go through --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t see into the future and \\nunderstand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the \\nPresident\\'s going to continue to reach out when he can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You don\\'t have any regrets then about the way you \\nhave handled it up to now and you don\\'t plan any changes in your \\napproach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this \\nexperience?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like \\nhis package passed as quickly as possible and he\\'s going to continue \\nto press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, \\nthere\\'s not question about that.  And we\\'ll continue to reason with \\nthem and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this \\ncase the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around \\na plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  They\\'re being denied any other legislative means of \\nputting their proposals forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they\\'re being --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any ideas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being \\ndefeated; I don\\'t know that they\\'re being denied.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     to present them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s not exactly true.  I mean \\nthey get the votes --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that theirs can be passed though by the \\nparliamentary rules under which they\\'re playing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in \\nsupport all the way around, no, that\\'s not exactly true.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration \\nbacking any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we\\'re pressing for \\nIraqi compliance.  I don\\'t know if we can get into the business of \\ngrooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at \\nsome levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don\\'t know  about \\nanything recently.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the \\nPresident\\'s best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be \\nsome kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the \\nPresident, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider \\nsomething like that, or any other kind of intervention there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President \\nappointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a \\nspecial envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around \\nthe California economic situation, including the situation in Los \\nAngeles.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles \\nby the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, \\nMr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD \\nSecretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits \\nby Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I \\nwouldn\\'t rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to \\nCalifornia.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is \\nconcerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy \\ndecisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities \\nwhich help prevent disturbances.  But we\\'re going to continue to \\nwatch it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also \\nsupposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a \\ngroup of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball \\nmanagement.  Does the President have a position on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received \\ncorrespondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson \\nhas also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  \\nHe clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in \\nbaseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the \\nPresident intends to continue to go to the ball game.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see \\nReverend Jackson while he\\'s out there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if he is going to see \\nthem, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has \\nraised some serious questions, and it\\'s something that, as I said, \\neven though there has been progress, it\\'s clearly not enough.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball \\ngame?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure about that.  I believe \\nthe characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an \\ninformational pickett.  I don\\'t know that he asked him not to go to \\nthe ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining \\nhis concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the \\nPresident read it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the \\nmanaging partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be \\nthere, and is he going to meet with the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is the Mubarak schedule?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is \\ncoming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a \\nlunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice \\nPresident Gore.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And joint statements tomorrow --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, \\nyes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did \\nwarn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist \\nactivities?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, \\nI mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been \\ngeneral conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a \\nlong period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I \\nmean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there \\nwas no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  \\nThe President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also \\nreiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, \\napparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, \\nforgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at \\nthe moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in \\ntheir attempts to get some kind of action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know if I would \\nagree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did \\nsay that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a \\nnetwork in the United States and upon which we took appropriate \\naction.  But there was no specific information on this specific \\noperation at all.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So, the White House doesn\\'t feel that any of the \\nlaw enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have \\nreceived this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in \\nnot pursuing some kind of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s next with Serbia?  It got only a passing \\nmention in the news conference yesterday --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn\\'t get to ask your \\nquestion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted \\naction between the two countries?  And even if there wasn\\'t, what \\ndoes the U.S. do next?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going \\nto move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our \\nallies on a sanctions resolution and we\\'ll continue to look for ways \\nto press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an \\nagreement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, why do you think sanctions is still an \\noption?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the \\nleadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait \\nyou out and even the administration officials we had in the other day \\nsaid there\\'s no evidence that they\\'re going to have an effect any \\ntime soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When \\ndoes no mean no and you have to do something different?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something \\ndifferent.  We\\'re moving forward on further sanctions through the \\nU.N. and those discussions will continue.  We\\'re going to continue to \\ntry and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every \\nopportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? \\nMR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something \\nthat is under consideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham\\'s \\ncondition, how he\\'s doing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing\\'s changed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s a little unclear.  I think \\nwe\\'ll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning \\nafter the Mubarak visit.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he going somewhere for Easter?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What more can you tell us about the additional aid \\nto Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s going to be consulting with \\nthe Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  \\nI know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their \\ndelegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the \\nRussians this week and those consultations will continue over the \\nnext several weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude \\nof the one announced Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not going to discuss the \\nmagnitude.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where \\ndo you stand on that --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, \\nhe\\'s going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week \\nand reviewing it.  He believes -- he\\'s going to try and get it this \\nweek and he\\'s going to review the list, and we\\'re going to take a \\nhard look at it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But they\\'re making it up?  I mean it\\'s no White \\nHouse involvement, Congress is compiling this list?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he\\'s going to talk to the \\ncongressional leaders about compiling the list but I\\'m certain we\\'ll \\nbe able to get our own researchers working as well.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, isn\\'t lifting the arms embargo more of a \\nprobability than a possibility?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s something that\\'s under \\ndiscussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Christopher has said that it\\'s a matter \\nof time and -- for months before that happens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it\\'s \\nsomething that the President is reviewing.  Right now we\\'re working \\nwith our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we\\'ll \\ncontinue to review other matters.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule \\nthis week?  Any travel?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I \\ndon\\'t have anything more beyond tomorrow\\'s visit with Mubarak right \\nnow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish \\nAmerican organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference \\nof Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National \\nConference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  \\nWe\\'ll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate \\ndiscussions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thanks.\\n\\n\\n                                 ###\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Also getting the adulation\\nof many who believe his is their only hope (if not of cure,\\nthen of control) and seeing his name in publications put out\\nby support groups, etc.  This is a definite temptation.\\n\\n-- \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | \"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\" \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

Blowme)\\nSubject: new encryption\\nNntp-Posting-Host: rac3.wam.umd.edu\\nOrganization: University of Maryland, College Park\\nLines: 120\\n\\n   As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington\\nTimes article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company\\nis Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end\\nof this message on how to contact them).\\n\\n   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that\\nwe are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications\\nbrought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.\\n\\n   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the\\nrest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:\\n\\n - A company of AT&T\\'s size could never be able to make a decision to use\\n   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.\\n\\n - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T\\'s secure telephone\\n   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.\\n   This stuck them as strange, until now...\\n\\n\\n   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several\\nconcerns over the new Clipper Chip:\\n\\n  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.\\n\\n  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto\\n    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency\\n    of the government.\\n\\n  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm\\n    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.\\n\\n  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that\\n    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or\\n    changing the keys themselves.\\n\\n  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and\\n    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed\\n    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very\\n    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique\\n    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is\\n    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.\\n\\nAdditonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn\\'t tell\\nme much about their new agorithm because it hasn\\'t been patented yet.\\nHowever he told me a little:\\n\\n - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been\\n   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is\\n   secure.\\n\\n - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.\\n   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret\\n   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate\\n   the following:\\n\\n    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but\\n      Mr. Melnick stated \"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\")\\n\\n    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.\\n\\n    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).\\n\\n    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that\\n      it is _adujustable_ and is \"More than adequate for security.\"\\n\\n    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and\\n      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which\\n      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I\\n      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.\\n\\n    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques\\n      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the\\n      hardware chip.\\n\\n    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars\\n      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced\\n      enough, which probably won\\'t happen]).\\n\\n    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm\\n      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted\\n      data into \"blocks.\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know\\n      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported\\n      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.\\n\\n    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!\\n\\n\\n\\nRight now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out\\nof business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in\\nstopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard.

Affected programs include rgb and \\nthe server.\\n\\n\\tThis is from the GCC manual:\\n\\n\\tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \\n\\tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\\n\\tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \\n\\treference.\\n\\n\\tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\\n\\tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn\\'t straightforward to fix it.\\n\\n\\tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\\n\\t`-fpcc-struct-return\\' does not help.\\n\\nYou can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just\\nthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with \\ncompilation flags.  \\n\\n\\tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include:\\n\\t\\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \\n\\t\\trgb/rgb.c\\n\\n\\tIn addition, several of the \"inet_\" functions use structs as args or\\nreturn values:  \\n\\t\\tclients/xhost/xhost.c \\n\\t\\tclients/xauth/gethost.c. \\nCalls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly \\nharmless as they don\\'t involve structs.\\n\\n[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?\\nWhen I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \\n\\t\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \\n\\tFatal server bug! no screens found.\"\\n\\n\\tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn\\'t work.

[courtesy MIT X Consortium]\\n\\tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it\\nattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.\\nYou can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to\\nmost C compilers).\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)\\n\\nThis is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in \\nX11R4 (upon which OW 3.0\\'s libXt is based).  It wasn\\'t documented and was \\nremoved in X11R5 (MIT\\'s guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5\\nlibraries only applied to the documented interface).  \\n\\nA workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4\\nor OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.\\n\\n[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis \\n(jpf@heliocentric.com)]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?\\n\\n\\tThere is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)\\nrunning under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using \\nshared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:\\n\\t1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system\\nadministrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used\\nby these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security \\nproblems at your site.\\n\\t2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).\\n\\t3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths\\nto the libraries.\\n\\n[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]\\n\\nThe R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the\\nnewly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid\\nprogram from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this \\nmay cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. \\nXload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?\\n\\n\\tOn many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits \\nanyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by \\naccessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps\\nmore annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console \\ndisplay. Check the man page for fbtab(5).\\n\\n[Thanks to Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca); 2/93.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 105)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 106)  What is Imake?\\n\\n\\tImake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a\\nmakefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro-\\nprocessing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles \\nsuitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not \\nspecific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the \\nconfiguration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\\n\\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by\\nwhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration\\nfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not \\nobvious.\\n\\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and\\nR5 versions are different.\\n\\n\\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\\n\\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on\\nusing Imake to build X\\n\\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\\n\\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes\\' R3/R4\\nguide to imake.\\n\\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim\\nFulton on an early version of Imake\\n\\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful \\nexplanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-\\nsupported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu\\nin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and \\nconfig-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. \\n[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;\\nmail a message body of \"send imake-stuff help\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\\n\\t- see \"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\" by Dinah McNutt\\nin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\\n\\t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \"Das Meta-Make \\n/ I make, you make / Schwerelos\" by Rainer Klute in \"iX \\nMultiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\", directed at application programmers needing to\\nwrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The\\nX Journal, issue 2:1.\\n\\t- The O\\'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey\\'s article on\\ndemystifying Imake.\\n\\t- Alain Brossard\\'s working document full of tips on Imake is in \\nsasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.\\n\\n[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 107)  Where can I get imake?\\n\\n\\tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier \\nversion is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits \\nredistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the \\ntemplate and configuration files. There are no real standards for such \\nconfiguration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the \\ntemplates distributed with X11R5.\\n\\texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake\\nwithout picking up the entire distribution.\\n\\tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in\\nftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\\n\\n\\tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \"xmkmf\". This is a \\nscript which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a \\nMakefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, \\nwhich will use that new Makefile to compile the program.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 109)  Why can\\'t I link to the Xlib shape routines?\\nWhen I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\\n\\tUndefined:\\n\\t_XShapeQueryExtension\\n\\t_XShapeCombineMask\\n\\n\\tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)\\nwhich was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular\\nwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will \\nonly run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many \\nvendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case \\nthey will display rectangular windows anyway.\\n\\n\\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library \\nlibXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes\\nwill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do \\nnot despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be \\ncompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can\\nprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X \\nlibraries.\\n\\n[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 110)  What are these problems with \"_XtInherit not found\" on the Sun?\\nWhen I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the \\nerror \"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\".\\n\\n\\tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to \\nget Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can\\'t share a function that \\nis both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting \\n_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby \\nguaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where \\nXtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally\\nbe called.\\n\\n\\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal\\nXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \\n\\t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a \\nconnection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif\\'s 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called\\nXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your \\nprogram; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\\n\\t2) alternatively, your program doesn\\'t need any Xt functions and is\\ncorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView \\nprogram. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \\n\\n\\tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,\\nalthough this will certainly solve the problem.\\n\\t\\n[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); \\n11/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 111)  Why can\\'t I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?\\nI have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under \\nthe current version of X, I get this message:\\n\\tUndefined:\\n\\t_XtScrollBarSetThumb\\n\\t_XtTextSetInsertionPoint\\n\\t_XtTextReplace\\n\\n\\tThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition\\nto the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4\\nrelease notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but\\nare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.\\n[10/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 113)  Why doesn\\'t my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\\n\\n\\tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one\\nwindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the\\nwindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are\\ncalled \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you\\ncan use something like the following:\\n\\n        XWMHints wmhints;\\n        ...\\n        wmhints.flags = InputHint;\\n        wmhints.input = True;\\n        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)\\n\\nIf your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput \\nresource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don\\'t have\\nsource, you can start up the application with the resource \\'*input:True\\'.\\n\\nCertain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having \\nthis done. \\n\\n\\tIf you are using Sun\\'s OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource\\nto your defaults file to use clients that aren\\'t ICCCM-compliant.\\n\\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true\\n\\n[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\\n\\n\\tYou can\\'t reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be\\nspoofed in any case. \\n\\tFor most cases, you shouldn\\'t care which window manager is running, so \\nlong as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in \\nwhich particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for\\nparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can \\nsidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may \\nbe appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take\\nadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm\\'s push-pin menus) in order\\nto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window \\nmanager\\'s functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;\\nthis surely leads to future compatibility problems.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\\n\\t\\n\\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the \\nMacintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development \\nunder a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional \\ndevelopment. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive \\napplication builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good\\napplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just \\nthis one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that \\nputs up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for\\nquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 \\ndistributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and \\nR4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 \\nXlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  \\nby Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \\t[3/90]\\n\\n\\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute \\nshowing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display \\nconnection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\\n\\n\\tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is\\nsensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\\n\\t{\\n\\tArg args[3];\\n\\tint i;\\n\\tint sensitive;\\t\\t/* oops; wrong data type */\\n\\ti=0;\\n\\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\\n\\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\\n\\t...\\n\\t}\\n\\nBut XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; \\ndeclaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem \\ncomes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types \\nDimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar \\nproblems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you\\nuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget\\'s man page.\\n[11/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 117)  Why don\\'t XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\\n\\n\\tYou\\'re probably trying to use these functions from application code.\\nThey should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a \\nparent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising \\nfunctions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use \\nonly by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\\n\\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a\\nwidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.\\nAlthough this will result in the widget-internal functions\\' being called, your\\napplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the \\nwidgets\\' data becoming corrupted.\\n\\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be \\navoided; they shouldn\\'t be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 118)  Why isn\\'t there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\\n\\n\\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of\\nthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no\\nsuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for\\nthe \"new\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location\\nin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?\\nWhat should happen to the widget\\'s children? And by the time such semantics are\\ndefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old \\nwidget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired \\nresources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in \\ncreating a new widget.\\n\\n\\tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDavid B.

Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of\\nthe week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some\\nChristians prefer to refer to \"first day\", \"second day\", etc.  However\\nthe majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question\\nseems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows\\nas the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when\\nthey use it is different.\\n\\nIndeed I\\'d like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be\\ndangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the\\ncelebration of Christ\\'s resurrection.  Postings trying to convince\\nthem that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run\\nthe risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.\\nThey are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people\\'s minds\\nbetween their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It\\'s not clear that\\nthis is a healthy thing.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.\\n\\nOne is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related\\npublic relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:\\n\\n1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade\\n   Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not\\n   succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created\\n   the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist\\n   Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.\\n\\n2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and\\n   other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and\\n   outlaw state.\\n\\n3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I \\n   suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and\\n   perhaps intensify.\\n\\nWhy this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have\\nbeen behind this. These include:\\n\\n1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical\\n   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This\\n   movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily\\n   fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this \\n   movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return\\n   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of\\n   democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian\\n   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian\\n   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.\\n   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news\\n   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.\\n\\n2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia\\n   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil\\n   sources from this region.\\n\\n3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense\\n   expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of\\n   Soveit Union.\\n\\nThe recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed\\nfrom Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict\\nof interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the\\ninterest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal\\nand friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the\\nrise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .\\n\\n--jamshid\\n',\n",

Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.

If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\\n\\nFor power:\\n\\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\\n\\nFor amplitude\\n\\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\\n\\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\\n\\nCommon references for audio are:\\n\\n\\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\\n\\t0 dBV = 1 volt\\n\\n\\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\\n\\t0 VU = -10dBV\\t(consumer gear line level)\\n\\n\\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\\nor moment.\\n\\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\\n\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n\",\n",

The look and feel is\\nroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time\\nfighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,\\nespecially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to\\nstay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.

In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is \\nno fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain\\nmoderately challanging puzzles.\\n\\nThe really interesting thing about this game is that it is really \\nbroken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits\\nyou must enter.

Another exhibit\\ntraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines\\nand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant\\nzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue\\nsome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill\\nthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is\\nperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into\\nJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper\\nvictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must\\navoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and \\nmeet him face to face - but first get a disquise.

       " 'From: jamie@zikzak.apana.org.au (Jamie Scuglia)\\nSubject: Workspace Managers for Win 3.1 - a small review\\nOrganization: Zikzak Public Access UNIX, Melbourne Australia\\nLines: 56\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: zikzak.apana.org.au\\n\\nThanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for\\nWindows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia\\'s\\nMS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some\\nsites in the U.S.  The three I found were:\\n\\n1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)\\n                                This was the smallest and simplest\\n   of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.\\n   It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra\\n   button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the\\n   title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press\\n   a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would\\n   have been nice if there was an \"ALWAYS ON TOP\" setting for the little\\n   window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified\\n   strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be\\n   a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace\\n   manager makes it an attractive package.\\n\\n2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)\\n                               While this workspace manager offered a\\n   few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming\\n   to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace\\n   is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \"snapshots\"\\n   of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what \\n   applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,\\n   but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.\\n   With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in\\n   a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this\\n   viewing functionality which is quite useful.\\n\\n3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)\\n                            This is an interesting package, which contains\\n   a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies\\n   include \"Backmenu\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you\\n   press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu\\n   is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,\\n   which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could\\n   say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also\\n   bundled in \"backdesk.zip\" is a program called \"WRUN\", which allows\\n   you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS\\n   instead of using the File Manager to run applications.  \\n   The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite\\n   differently to the other two workspace managers in that it\\n   doesn\\'t provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.\\n   In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,\\n   and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to\\n   focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different\\n   viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which\\n   each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window\\n   allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically\\n   the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area\\n   while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up\\n   of a particular section.\\n\\nTry each of them out for yourself.  I was impressed with all of them,\\nso find out which one suits your needs the best.\\n',\n",

Ages & sexes of children\\n     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl\\n\\n>2.  Do you spank your kids?\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.\\n\\n>3.  If so how often?\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking because it\\'s more of a reaction to something\\nvery dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running\\ninto the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\\nnot been spanked yet.\\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they\\'re still loved.\\n\\n>4.  Do you use an implement to spank with?\\n     No, that would be too painful.  If it\\'s too traumatic they never recall\\nwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\\nto go get a toolmeans you\\'re not doing it right away, and that lessens the\\nimpact.  It\\'s very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\\nis called a spanking.\\n>\\n>5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?\\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\\nsure they didn\\'t play together for 5 days so he\\'d know that would make him\\nlose friends very quickly.  He\\'s never done anything like that since.\\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don\\'t keep\\narguing with me over leaving, since it\\'s hard to argue with a macine.\\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won\\'t be over until they\\ncalm down if they\\'re too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they\\'re\\nreally young.\\n\\n>6.  Your age?\\n     40\\n\\n>7.  Your location\\n     Bath, Ohio.  It\\'s right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.\\n\\n>8.  While under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal\\n>offence?\\n     No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to\\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn\\'t always required - parents use\\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\\n\\n>9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid\\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband\\'s have never\\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God\\'s law.\\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I\\'ll admit I\\'ve been tempted with\\nat times.  When I\\'ve felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\\ndevil\\'s work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God\\'s\\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.\\n-- \\nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, \\'cause Heaven is just a great\\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\\n',\n",

This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\\n\\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\\n\\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn\\'t  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\\nEvangelical Churches.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\\nMonophysitism.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    \\'-------------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n\\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\\nheretical probably aren\\'t.\\n\\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\\nrejected who didn\\'t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\\nthe Antiochene tradition.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

Friday local Tel Aviv\\'s\\npaper, affiliated with Maariv.\\n\\nDate: 19 February 1993\\n\\nJournalist: Guy Ehrlich\\n\\nSubject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan\\n(Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate\\nwithin the occupied territories.\\n\\nExcerpts from the article:\\n\\n\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as\\nArabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most\\nimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is\\nthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one\\nway or another insane\".\\n\\nA man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name\\nis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge\\nfrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be\\ncalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to\\ndepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different\\nfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript\\nservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completely\\ndifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures\\nabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of their\\nfellows from the Cherry it woundn\\'t be easy either. Yet after they\\nbegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.\\nThe following article will contain all the horror stories\\nrecounted with an appalling openness.\\n\\n(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in\\nwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We\\ncalled such soldiers H.I. \\'Hit by the Intifada\\'. Under my command\\nwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common\\nphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I\\nshould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On\\nFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to\\nuntil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The\\nkeys of my father\\'s car must be ready for in advance, so that I\\ncan go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don\\'t\\nwant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it\\ninstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time\\nand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only\\nthere I become normal.(...)\\n\\n(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\\nIt was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\\nme and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\\nwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\\nexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began\\nto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh\\nstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a\\nmincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\\ncocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\\nthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\\nthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\\nwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\\nArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\\nhim straight in his ass. We both felt that we\\'d pulled off\\nsomething.\\n\\nNext I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\\nin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\\nspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\\nblood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: \\'Shut\\nup\\' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\\nstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\\nsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: \\'All\\nright, wait a moment\\'. I left him in order to take a look at\\nanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\\nsaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\\nhelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\\nthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\\ninto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\\nI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he\\nomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over\\nher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn\\'t know\\nwhat to say.\\n\\n(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls\\nupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a\\nfield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\\nshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\\nhill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\\nWe enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\\ndeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\\nsaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\\nsuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\\ninspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\\nthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\\nhad hit\\'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\\nso as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\\nrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\\ndistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\\nbullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\\noutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\\nblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\\nmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like\\nbeasts of prey. We couldn\\'t explain what had happened to us. We\\nwere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we\\nfelt the whole day very badly.\\n\\n(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.\\nThis is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may\\nbe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel\\nGodlike of sorts.\"\\n\\n(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment\\nstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any\\nsecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. \\'Why\\nshouldn\\'t I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?\\nWhy shouldn\\'t I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver\\nwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits\\nme perfectly. I have no human emotions any more.

Bonner also offers a reminder that\\n    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of\\n    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.\\n\\nThe chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\\nissue of USA Today (\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders\" by Mike\\nSnider, p. 6D).\\n\\n    Adolescents\\' choices\\n\\n    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:\\n                      Estimated, per 100 students\\n                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.\\n    Alcohol                  25.1     26.1        +4%\\n    Cigarettes               14.3     15.5        +8%\\n    Marijuana                 3.2      3.7       +16% \\n    Amphetamines              2.6      3.3       +27%\\n    LSD                       0.6      0.9       +50%\\n    Cocaine                   0.5      0.7       +40%\\n    Crack                     0.3      0.5       +67%\\n\\n    Source:  University of Michigan Institute for Social Research,\\n    1993 report\\n\\nWe are not winning the \"war on drugs\".  I think you can see that one\\nof the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that\\nthe \"war on drugs\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---\\nonly statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone\\ndown.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is\\nan excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to\\ndeceive the public.\\n\\nUsage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same\\ntime usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).\\nAlso, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down\\nbut drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,\\nif one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*\\nthe statistics, then it\\'s obvious that the so-called \"war on drugs\" is\\nbeing lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs\\ngo, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,\\nthen the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed\\nin its true perspective.\\n\\nFor those of you who don\\'t consider alcohol to be a drug then try\\ndrinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me\\nthat it\\'s not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*\\ndrugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless\\nattempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to\\nanother drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.\\n\\nThe solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to\\nlegalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be\\nwithin reasonable limits (you won\\'t drop dead after using it a few\\ntimes) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.\\nThe reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is\\nbecause people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the\\ngovernment\\'s efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug\\ninterdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug\\neducation).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because\\nthe profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often\\ngoes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that\\naddicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their\\nmoney and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;\\nlegalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall\\nsubstantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.\\n\\nIMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been\\ndone to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to\\nemploy heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating\\nthem.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than\\nthey used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought\\nabout by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can\\nlight up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in\\norder to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods\\nbe used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried\\nout.  They are as follows:\\n\\n    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which\\n      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this\\n      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.\\n      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used\\n      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.\\n\\n    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of\\n      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs\\n      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from\\n      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law\\n      enforcement.\\n\\n    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of\\n      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the\\n      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.\\n      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning\\n      information should also be a felony.\\n\\n    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the\\n      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This\\n      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad\\n      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.\\n\\nI\\'m sure that many of the things I\\'ve discussed in this article have\\nbeen hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought\\nit was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...)\\nall at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on\\nWOD.

Since the existence of\\n     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further\\n     provocation is required.\\n\\n  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant\\n     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans\\n     without positive identification as military personnel, clear\\n     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.\\n\\n    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for\\n       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively\\n       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or\\n       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note\\n       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,\\n       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive\\n       military identification and require closer inspection such\\n       as document checks.\\n\\n    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely \\'hostile\\' intent,\\n       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less\\n       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals\\n       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a\\n       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,\\n       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.\\n       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to\\n       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify\\n       armed response.\\n\\n    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive\\n       military identification of all personnel in the target area of\\n       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not\\n       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft\\n       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the\\n       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously\\n       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of\\n       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov\\n       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to\\n       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should\\n       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.\\n       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters\\n       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated\\n       if necessary.\\n\\n--- D.

       " 'From: Grant@DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL (Lynn R Grant)\\nSubject: Another key registration body bites the dust (IMHO)\\nOrganization: Yale CS Mail/News Gateway\\nLines: 46\\n\\nOne of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration\\nbody is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is\\nessentially a group of auditors: they audit how people\\'s civil\\nliberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get\\ninvolved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good\\nreason.\\n\\nWhen I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the\\nauditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a\\nsecurity point of view, but wouldn\\'t tell us how to fix it.  I always\\nfigured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix\\nthe problem.\\n\\nThen I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.\\nAuditors don\\'t like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a\\nbad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The\\nauditee can say, \"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\"  It\\ncompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor\\'s\\njob.\\n\\nTaking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.\\nSuppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU\\'s part, a key half gets\\naway that shouldn\\'t, and is used to deprive someone of her civil\\nliberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.\\nBut they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant\\nand of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.\\n\\nThere are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one\\nplace where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed\\nautomatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum\\nwas kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and\\nwas brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.\\n\\nI believe the difference between this situation and the key registration\\nsituation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll\\nchecks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again\\ntoday, he better be able to produce yesterday\\'s checks so that they can\\nbe destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are\\nlegit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could\\nput the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU\\nconflict of interest.\\n\\nAs always, my opinions are my own.\\n\\nLynn Grant\\nGrant@Dockmaster.NCSC.MIL\\n',\n",

Good thing, because the Blues quit\\nplaying.\\n\\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\\nTampa\\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\\nsupervisor John D\\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\\n\\n``I\\'m glad I didn\\'t see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\\n\\nIf the goal had counted, he\\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\\'\\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\\'s anger.\\n\\n``It wasn\\'t pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\\ncan\\'t allow five goals like we did, that\\'s not right.\\n\\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\\n\\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\\' effort. Somehow,\\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\\'s loss.\\n\\n``I didn\\'t know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\\nbench. I didn\\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\\'re in the playoffs,\\nand that\\'s great, but it\\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning.

The parts are\\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\\n\\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \\nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\\n* What is an attack?\\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\\n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\\n\\n\\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\\n\\n  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a\\n  decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of\\n  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of\\n  ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the\\n  decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that\\n  D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption\\n  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key\\n  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext\\n  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to\\n  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.\\n\\n* What is an attack?\\n\\n  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method\\n  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their\\n  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out\\n  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state\\n  mathematically what this means. Here we go.\\n\\n  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,\\n  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.\\n\\n  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an\\n  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that\\n  there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have\\n  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this\\n  probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).\\n\\n  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at\\n  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and\\n  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible\\n  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other\\n  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions\\n  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).\\n\\n  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if\\n  n = 2, and so on.\\n\\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\\n\\n  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.\\n  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this\\n  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem\\n  is strong!''\\n\\n  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely\\n  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is\\n  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against\\n  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as\\n  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this\\n  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist\\n  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement\\n  to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that\\n  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.\\n\\n  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical\\n  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions\\n  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can\\n  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used\\n  properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.\\n\\n  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst\\n  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to\\n  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,\\n  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.\\n  \\n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\\n\\n  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the\\n  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)\\n  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive\\n  or) of K and P.\\n\\n  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial\\n  single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform\\n  distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform\\n  distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,\\n  i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,\\n  with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and\\n  g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of\\n  K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also\\n  be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is\\n  uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p\\n  that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus\\n  a fortiori A is trivial.)\\n\\n  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used\\n  for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial\\n  multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be\\n  thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';\\n  this explains the name ``one-time pad.''\\n\\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\\n\\n  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is\\n  constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about\\n  n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some\\n  information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial\\n  if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given\\n  G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.\\n\\n  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can\\n  easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply\\n  guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use\\n  the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no\\n  matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which\\n  produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.\\n  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is\\n  a nontrivial attack.\\n\\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\\n\\n  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,\\n  G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.\\n  In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption\\n  P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the\\n  other decryption P_2.\\n\\n  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature\\n  as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the\\n  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him\\n  decrypt further messages.\\n\\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\\n\\n  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical\\n  series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the\\n  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into\\n  our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a\\n  chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and\\n  look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured\\n  out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of\\n  attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''\\n\\n  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption\\n  attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a\\n  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.\\n\\n  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:\\n  for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as\\n  T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew\\n  for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash\\n  function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.\\n\\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\\n\\n  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some\\n  plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're\\n  also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find\\n  K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).\\n\\n  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed\\n  on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results\\n  only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial\\n  attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many\\n  possible keys.\\n\\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\\n\\n  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys\\n  randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to\\n  for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which\\n  are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English\\n  words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much\\n  faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.\\n\\n  We can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its\\n  entropy. This number E is the number of ``real bits of information''\\n  of the key: a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within\\n  2^E guesses. E is defined as the sum of -p_K log_2 p_K, where p_K is\\n  the probability of key K.\\n\",\n",

First \\nsome background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, \\nand am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on \\nit.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician \\nGold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by \\nhaving a device driver detect whenever more than one read is \\nnecessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, \\nand minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard \\ndrive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad \\nsectors a week.\\n \\n        Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with \\nan Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this \\nmessage twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program \\nand did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining \\nfor new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about \\nsectors for a brief period of time.\\n \\n        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the \\nexact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the \\nsame error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went \\nto the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough \\nthere was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, \\nbut removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, \\neither audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the \\ncache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.\\n \\n        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix \\nthem, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are \\nno errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other \\nfiles, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them \\nfor a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to \\ncompletely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through \\nthe c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.\\n \\n        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on \\nmy hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in \\nabout every 100 files are affected.  \\n \\n        I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s \\nsystem, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about \\nsmartdrv to help me out.\\n\\n--                    \\nINTERNET:  jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver)\\nUUCP:   ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriver\\nNetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego, CA (619) 453-1115\\n\",\n",

I thought that if we were to have to come up with\\nrubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. \"Body of Christ\" -- \"Amen\"\\nfor receiving Communion), that they could be \"I am not responsible for\\nthe blood of this man.\"\\n\\n   Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (\"Blessed are You, God of\\nall creation...\") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The\\npriest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to\\nothers, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion\\nthat night (we aren\\'t required to anyway -- I instead offered up\\nprayers for our priests and parish).\\n\\n>So we\\'ve been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\\n>going down?

Your 2F2 cap\\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\\nThe other point is that big electro\\'s are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\\nthe cold).\\n\\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\\nthat \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\\n1,209,600 seconds.

Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\\n\\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\\n\\nCaveat - I\\'m not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can\\'t\\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\\nconditions.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

In the extreme case, a  \\nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \\nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \\n\\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \\nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \\ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \\n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \\n\\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \\nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \\nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \\nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \\na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \\nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \\ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \\nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \\ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \\nthrough the mistakes they made.  \\n\\nIn article <1993Apr14.171230.16138@kestrel.edu> king@reasoning.com \\n    (Dick King) writes:\\n>  [ Somebody writes: ]\\n>>I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....\\n>  ....\\n>He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a\\n>universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not.\\n>         ....\\n>Einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put out\\n>there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them.\\n\\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  \"If it\\'s not supported by\\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it\\'s not science.\"\\n\\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \\nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \\nof science.  \\n\\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \\nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \\nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \\nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don\\'t in the least believe that this \\nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \\nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \\ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \\narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \\n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \\nwith anything worthwhile.  \\n\\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\\n\\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\\nareas of psychology.

This includes things like software inspection, a\\n   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,\\n   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the\\n   project.\\n\\n4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered\\n   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this\\n   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.\\n\\n5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts\\n   are effective and certified.\\n\\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\\n\",\n",

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\\nprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\\nour lives into \"before\" and \\'\\'after.\" We talk like that: that was before the\\nwar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\\nepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\\nit will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \\nsharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\\n. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\\ninhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\\nlosses and everything that happened.\\n\\nNineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\\nto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\\nbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \\nthose who didn\\'t.\\n\\nThat second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \\ncould already smell danger in the air. But we didn\\'t think that the danger was\\nnear and possible, so we didn\\'t take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\\nmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \\nMy parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\\nthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\\n\\nIn our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\\nafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\\nour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\\ncrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\\nlike it\\'s all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \\napartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \\nhis hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \\nlocked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We\\'re known as a \\nhospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \\nwho were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\\nof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\\n\\nMy parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \\nmother, \"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\" But Mother was detached, pale, as \\nthough she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \\nexpected it of her, she\\'s afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \\ngirlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \\n\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you\\'re not to come out \\nof the bedroom. We\\'re going to tell them that we\\'re alone in the apartment.\"\\n\\nWe went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \\ncrawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\\nKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \\nperhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \\nme. I\\'m an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\\nembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \\nwas thinking the same thing, but she\\'s quite reserved. We didn\\'t have time to \\nsay anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \\nThere was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\\nexcited voices. I couldn\\'t figure what was going on out there because the door\\nto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\\nKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\\nbut when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \\nimmediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \\nleast so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \\neyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\\nin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn\\'t see. They \\ncame into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \\nroom. He didn\\'t utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \\nsnatched the axe from behind and said, \"Tell them not to touch the children. \\nTell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" She\\nsaid this to Father in Armenian.\\n\\nThere were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \\nunderstood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don\\'t know Armenian, \\nthey don\\'t need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \"You and \\nyour children both . . . we\\'re going to do the same thing to you and your \\nchildren that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \\nour mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and \\nso on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" This whole time\\nsome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \\nwere mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren\\'t any older people \\namong them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \\nall the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I\\'m \\na teacher.\\n\\nSo they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \\nhim in there, no they didn\\'t take him in there, they dragged him in there,\\nbecause he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \\nbut a crack. We couldn\\'t see what was happening to Father, what they were \\ndoing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \\nMamma\\'s sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \"I\\'m old enough to \\nbe your mother! What are you doing?!\" He struck her. Now he\\'s being held, \\nMamma identified him. I hope he\\'s convicted. Then they went after Karina, \\nwho\\'s been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \\nto lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \\nconsciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \\nmustn\\'t do it. She said, \"Come on, let\\'s straighten this out, without \\nemotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \\never do to you?\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \\ninto our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \\ncoming--said, \"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \\ncame here to kill them.\"\\n\\nThey pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \\ndidn\\'t cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"What\\ndid we do to you? What did we do to you?\" And even later, when she came to, \\nshe said, \"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\"\\n\\nThat group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \\nbroke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \\nwere beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \\nnor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \\nwas watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\\ndid to her. That\\'s why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \\nthey beat her savagely . . . It\\'s really amazing that she not only lived, but \\ndidn\\'t lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \\ncould to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \\nkicking her, using anything they could find.\\n\\nMamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn\\'t feel any pain, \\njust didn\\'t feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \\ndid. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn\\'t enough room in the\\napartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \\ncorners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \"Let\\'s take her \\noutside.\"\\n\\nThose beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \\nweren\\'t afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \\nI thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren\\'t \\nafraid of what would happen to them.\\n\\nWhen they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \\nwith blood--that\\'s when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \\ntimes from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \\nI were recording it all on film. I think I\\'m a kind person by nature, but I\\'m \\nvengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don\\'t deserve it. I hold \\na grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \\nI would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I\\'d remember them, \\nand I\\'ll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \\n\"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.\\n\\nAt some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \\ndespite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\\nthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\\nto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \\nto an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\\nhe\\'s being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\\nand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\\nme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\\nthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\\nwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \\nreally deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \\nsuddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \\nI felt myself flying. I couldn\\'t figure out if I was really flying or if I \\njust imagined it. When I came to I thought now I\\'m going to smash on the \\nground. And when it didn\\'t happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \\nstill lying on the floor. And since I didn\\'t scream, didn\\'t beg them at all,\\nthey became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\\ntheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\\ncially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\\n\\nI came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \\nSome people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn\\'t \\nneed any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \\neven forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn\\'t worth \\nliving.\\n\\nThere was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \\npain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \\nbecause I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \\nand when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\\nput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \\nperson who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \\nbecause he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \\nhas four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \\none who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \\neven during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, \\nalthough, of course, he knew that I\\'d never forgive him. Something like that \\nI can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \\nwords, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person\\'s shoes,\\nbut then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \\nforget it.\\n\\nI wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \\ncould protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \\nbeasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn\\'t be able to do anything.\\nI knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\\n\\nAnd Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\\ncouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn\\'t, so he tried to \\nkill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \\nend to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \\nthe other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don\\'t know which one it \\nwas, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \\nthrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \\nand made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \\nthe deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \\nfrom the Melkumians\\' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \\nlittle. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\\nhow we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He\\'s a good person. He said, \\n\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\\nI, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\" he\\nsays, \"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \\nthink I never shall again.\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw \\neverything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \\nthe father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \\nsaw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\\npeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \\nbrothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \\nthey were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \\ndo something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\\n\\nAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \\nLyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn\\'t even \\nremember my sister\\'s name. I wanted to cry \"Marina!\" out to her, but could\\nnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn\\'t\\nfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\\nI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\\ntold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\\nthere by chance, that they weren\\'t Armenians. Lyuda\\'s a Russian, you can tell \\nright away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\\nshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I\\'m glad \\nthat at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \\nalthough her spirit was murdered . . .\\n\\nAt some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \\nmob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \\nname, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \"Igor,\\nhelp!\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \\ntaking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \\nLyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \\nneighbors.\\n\\nAnd the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \\nsomething like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\\n \\nThen they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \\nthey were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \\nonto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \\nsure that I was dead because I didn\\'t react at all to the new blows. Someone \\nsaid, \"She\\'s already dead, let\\'s throw her out.\" When they carried me out onto\\nthe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \\nheard someone say in Azerbaijani: \"Don\\'t kill her, I know her, she\\'s a \\nteacher.\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can\\'t remember\\nwhose voice it was. It wasn\\'t Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \\naccent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\\nAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\\nthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and \\tI having opened my \\neyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \\nbeen beaten so much that I didn\\'t have the strength to remember him. I only \\nremember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \\nI can\\'t remember anything more.\\n\\nWhat should I say about Igor? He didn\\'t treat me badly. I had heard a lot \\nabout him, that he wasn\\'t that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\\nmuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \\nwomen usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\\nif he was wounded, then it\\'s about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\\nvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \\nUfa, and was injured, but that\\'s not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \\nall out later.\\n\\nAmong the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \\nof the Party organization. I don\\'t know his last name, his first name is \\nNajaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn\\'t so sure,\\nshe was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \\ndidn\\'t want to endanger him. She said, \"He was there,\" and a little while \\nlater, \"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \\nNo, it seems like it was he.\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see \\nus the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \\nentirely different. The investigators haven\\'t summoned him yet. He came to see\\nus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \\ngroceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \\ncrying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don\\'t know if he was putting \\nus on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \\nhim to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn\\'t in Sumgait. \\nThe fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \\nright, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don\\'t know how the \\ninvestigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\\ntold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn\\'t he have gone \\nto Baku and arranged an alibi? I\\'m not ruling out that possibility.\\n\\nIll now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \\nbought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \\nwedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband\\'s \\nlives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \\nRussian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He\\'s an orphan who was raised by\\nhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \\nspecial school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I\\'ll say this--I\\'m \\na teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\\nboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He\\'s healthy, he can think just fine, \\nand analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he\\'s cunning, too. \\nAfter that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\\n\\nHe beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"Lady, if you give us all the gold \\nand money in your apartment we\\'ll let you live.\" And Mamma told them where \\nthe gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \\neveryone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \\nover and taking the gold from one another. I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t kill one \\nanother right then.\\n\\nMamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\\nblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \\nran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\\nmouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\\nlow. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn\\'t walk; like me, he was half dead, \\nhalfway into the other world. He couldn\\'t comprehend anything, couldn\\'t see, \\nand was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \\nit was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\\n\\nThe bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \\nout of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\\na small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \\nwere standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \\neverywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\\nservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \"I was afraid \\nto turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \\nthreshold I couldn\\'t hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \\ndragged him down the stairs to the neighbors\\'.\" Mamma remembered one of the \\ncriminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \\nout of one eye. She says, \"I realized that my death would come from that \\nperson. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\"\\nLater they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\\n\\nI was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \\nwas already outside, I didn\\'t know what they were doing to her. I was left all\\nalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\\nthough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\\nLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\\nI went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \\nBut when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \\nI had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \\nones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \\nthat all of that would die with me.\\n\\nAt some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \\ndidn\\'t know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\\nwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\\nyou?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\\nI would remember him. That\\'s when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \\ntaken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \\ntake the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\\nhad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \\nstarted getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \\nThe newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor\\'s axe froze in \\nthe air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \\npresence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \\nor not. He said, \"Enough, let\\'s go to the third entryway.\" In the third \\nentryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \\nagain that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \\nthey went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \\nfound, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \\nalready taken the other.\\n\\nFour people remained in the room, soldiers who didn\\'t obey their general. They\\nhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\\nthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \\nidentified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \\nAzerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\\n\"Sister, don\\'t be afraid, I\\'ll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\"\\nThat\\'s just what he said, \"those Azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not \\nAzerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"I\\'ll drive\\nthem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\\nand nail the door shut, because they\\'ll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \\nThat\\'s when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \\nperson in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \\nto, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\\n\\nKuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn\\'t do it by myself. \\nMarina\\'s old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\\nwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \\nHe wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \\nBut the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\\n\\nI went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \\nfrom flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \\nanything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won\\'t leave you here. Would any of the \\nneighbors let you in? They\\'ll be back, they won\\'t calm down, they know you\\'re \\nalive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\\n\\nThen he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \\nThey said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \\nyourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \\ncoarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\\nboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\\ndown to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What\\'s the mat-\\nter, aren\\'t you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\\nhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \\nhe couldn\\'t hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \\ntold him at the neighbors\\' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\\ngood terms with them.\\n\\nWe knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \\nopened the door and immediately said, \"I\\'m an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \\nLet her sit at your place a while. Don\\'t open the door to anyone, no one knows\\nabout this, I won\\'t tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\\nhave her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \\nhad gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \\ntears. Even though I was wearing Marina\\'s old fur coat, it\\'s a short one, a \\nhalf-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \\nis, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don\\'t know anything. I\\'m afraid \\nto go out of the apartment, now they\\'re so wild that they don\\'t look to see \\nwho\\'s Azerbaijani and who\\'s Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \\nneighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don\\'t want to lose my life because of you, \\nor my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\\napartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\\nearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \\nstill there. When I\\'m nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \\ntouched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\\nto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\\n\\nI went out and didn\\'t know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \\ndon\\'t know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \\nend up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \\napartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \\nI had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \\nhidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \\nsome broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \\nThen they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \\nthink that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\\nbroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \\nthere without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \\ncould hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that\\'s what saved me. They were \\nburning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\\npicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father\\'s sport \\njacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\\none end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \\nAnd again I realized I wasn\\'t getting out of there alive, and I started to \\nstrangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \\nmy mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\\nafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \\nburned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone\\'s hand was\\nprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn\\'t know \\nhow. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \\nI found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \\nhad never been so close to death and couldn\\'t imagine how you could go on \\nliving without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \\nthought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda\\'s place or someone is hiding her. \\nI tried to think that Igor wouldn\\'t let them be killed. He served in \\nAfghanistan, he should protect her.\\n\\nWhile I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\\nthought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \\nshe live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \\nthemselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\\nchildren\\'s footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \\nAnother said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \\njob fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \\nall over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \\nhave four children, and there are three rooms here, that\\'s just what I need. \\nAll these years I\\'ve been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \\n\"Neither of you gets it. We\\'ll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \\nthat Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\\nplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn\\'t set fire to the apartment, and\\nleft.\\n\\nOh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \\nfrequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \\nthem bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \\nsaid, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \\nvery often.\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

This is logically bankrupt --\\n>where is the proof of this nonexistence?  It\\'s a joke.\\n\\n This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the \\n belief that you can\\'t deny anything that you can\\'t prove doesn\\'t exist.\\n This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are\\n conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have\\n to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe\\n in objects or beings that haven\\'t been proved not to exist so why stop at\\n God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan\\n except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond\\n hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can\\'t see them)  The \\n reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians\\n have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.\\n\\n>Fine, but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of\\n>a God?  Here again is a classic atheist fallacy.\\n\\n How did they shoot themselves in the foot?\\n\\n>\\tRadical Muslims, the Crusades, the Inquisition are common examples that\\n>atheists like to bring up as marks against religion.

(This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this\\n  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because\\n  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the\\n  russians that helped Stalin that weren\\'t atheists - don\\'t they contradict\\n  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant\\n  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists\\n  can\\'t value life as much as theists (which you didn\\'t support).  \\n\\n>\\tAgnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable.

This in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is,\\n>though it\\'s less arrogant and pompous.\\n\\n Ah, and here\\'s another point you didn\\'t get out of the FAQ.  An atheist\\n doesn\\'t have to hold the positive view that god doesn\\'t exist, he/she may\\n just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here\\'s the example:\\n \\n Strong atheism - \"I believe god does not exist\"   a positive belief\\n\\n Weak atheism   - \"I don\\'t believe in a god\"       a negative belief\\n \\n these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of\\n god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that\\n you are calling unreasonable.  Or let\\'s look at it this way (in sets)\\n \\n suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent\\n as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas\\n exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person\\n not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that\\n even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:\\n \\n christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god\\n \\n atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)\\n \\n atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set\\n \\n agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E\\', ....) \\n\\n\\n>\\tWhy are people so afraid to say \"undecided\"?

As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.\\nThey showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is\\nthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as\\nhydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman\\nconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out\\nof kilter, and you get sick and die.\\n\\nI\\'ve never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real\\nlife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this\\nbook, I would imagine you would have to:\\n\\n1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy\\n   water.\\n\\n2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other\\n   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.\\n\\nDuring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and\\neventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the\\npoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the\\nwater the victim ingested was heavy.\\n\\nYou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both\\nalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly\\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\\nstory here.\\n\\nCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was\\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\\n\\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim\\'s body fluids\\nwould literally be \"heavy\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim\\'s weight will increase by\\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe\\nthe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that\\nthe victim\\'s urine is strangely dense.

In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\\n\\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\\na very troubling one.\\n\\nThe problem with `absolute certainty\\' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\\n\\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\\n\\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\\nTruth.\\n\\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\\n\\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\\n\\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\\n\\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\\n\\n\\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let\\'s go back to our shorthand method of doing\\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\\n\\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\\n\\n B: How do you know?\\n\\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\\n\\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\\n\\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\\n\\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn\\'t mean it is\\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\\n\\n A: ...\\n\\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \"I\\ncan\\'t prove that there are no mistakes\" -- and as long as you may have made a\\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\\n\\nThere is no way out of the loop.\\n\\n\\nThis is where the \"arrogance of Christians\" arises: many people believe\\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\\n\\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\\n\\n *\\n\\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\\nknowably Inerrant.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded.\"\\n                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein\\n',\n",

Liability issues\\n    are wholly unresolved.\\n  \\n  - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP\\n    software (see the question on cryptography). \\n\\n  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)\\n    vary between sites.\\n\\n  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are\\n    mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.\\n\\n_____\\n<8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?\\n\\n  \\n  Users\\n  -----\\n\\n  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the\\n    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.\\n  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.\\n  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on\\n    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.\\n  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.\\n    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases\\n    network traffic.\\n  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this\\n    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt\\'\\n    hierarchy is preferred.\\n  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.\\n    references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for\\n    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any\\n    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even\\n    future ones under the same handle.\\n  - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your\\n    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by\\n    sending anonymized mail to yourself.\\n  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. \\n    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.\\n  - Be considerate and respectful of other\\'s objections to anonymity.\\n  - ``Hit-and-run\\'\\' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.\\n    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.\\n  - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large\\n    amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating\\n    his hardware, all for your convenience.\\n\\n  Operators\\n  ---------\\n\\n  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an\\n    introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and\\n    consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and\\n    monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and\\n    security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or\\n    lassaiz-faire?\\n  - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate\\n    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user\\n    is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user\\n    posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your\\n    users trust you to protect them.\\n  - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations\\n    where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.\\n    warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke\\n    the account, \\'out\\' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)\\n  - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.\\n    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly\\n    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with\\n    users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under\\n    ``(in)stability of anonymity\\'\\'.\\n  - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?\\n    What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is\\n    your commitment to it?\\n  - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an\\n    address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. \\n    Consult a lawyer about your liability.\\n  - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared\\n    to deal with complaints and `hate mail\\' addressed to you.  If you\\n    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system\\n    adminstrator, consult those who do and are.\\n  - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If\\n    possible, query group readers.\\n  - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message\\n    format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure\\n    the key text `Anon\\' is  somewhere in every header.\\n  - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from\\n    physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.\\n\\n  Readers\\n  -------\\n  \\n  - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason\\n    that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that\\n    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail\\n    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its\\n    volume is heavy or increasing).\\n  - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters\\n    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate\\n    responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.\\n  - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,\\n    harassment, extortion, etc.\\n  - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they\\n    offend you personally.\\n  - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the\\n    idea of anonymity itself.\\n  - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings\\n    should be barred from particular groups because no `possible\\' or\\n    `conceivable\\' need exists.\\n\\n  References\\n  ----------\\n  \\n  See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:\\n\\n  > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual\\n  > privacy and the use of handles.

One of the first was one by Dave Mack\\n  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was\\n  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)\\n  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided\\n  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up\\n  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous\\n  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through\\n  servers like there\\'s no tomorrow.\\'\\'\\n  \\n  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax\\' and interested in\\n  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste\\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system\\n  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the\\n  server to new, more `mainstream\\'  groups was starting to emerge,\\n  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by\\n  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended\\n  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group\\n  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was\\n  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.\\'\\' \\n  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an\\n  anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus\\n  against it. \\n\\n  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher\\'\\' to\\n  `squelch\\' or `plonk\\' abusive users in response to complaints, and\\n  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of\\n  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his\\n  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to\\n  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the\\n  facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was\\n  created.\\'\\'\\n\\n  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most\\n  controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on\\n  scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized\\n  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine\\n  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide\\n  accessability in response to \\'lots\\' of international requests.\\n  \\n  J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet\\n  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological\\n  opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).\\n  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,\\n  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than\\n  ``routine\\'\\' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of\\n  anonymity is also controversial.\\n\\n  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb\\n  1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate\\n  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via\\n  anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been\\n  posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then\\n  non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a\\n  New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of\\n  vociferous outrage at the poster\\'s use of anonymity, reverberating\\n  through many newsgroups. \\n  \\n  The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded\\n  that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,\\'\\'\\n  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was\\n  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of\\n  the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived\\n  association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries\\n  for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous\\n  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his\\n  detractors.\\n\\n  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal\\n  opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news\\n  operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire\\n  extingisher\\'\\' and the ``group bouncer\\'\\' mechanisms that limit the\\n  scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is\\n  best described as `inundated\\': it has registered over 13,000 users\\n  in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a\\n  day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized\\n  through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due\\n  to the capability for `global\\' anonymity which has allowed users to\\n  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.\\n\\n  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to\\n  dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste\\n  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate\\n  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages\\n  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to\\n  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several\\n  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing\\' through it\\n  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5\\n  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the\\n  service\\'s administration. In response to the serious threats he\\n  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and\\n  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.\\n  \\n  Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by\\n  ``cypherpunks,\\'\\' J. Helsingius has identified many security\\n  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is\\n  currently in the process of code development and testing. He is\\n  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon\\n  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new\\n  system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple\\n  email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,\\n  etc.\\n\\n  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.\\n  1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography\\n  in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of\\n  confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public\\n  access account, and he had to shut it down after only several\\n  weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately\\n  originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the\\n  software to the public domain.\\n\\n  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing\\' on\\n  government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and\\n  group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the\\n  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,\\n  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable\\n  digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in\\n  the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to\\n  attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing\\n  easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and\\n  encryption.\\n\\n  See also sections on ``views on anonymous posting\\'\\' below and ``what\\n  is going on with anon.penet.fi?\\'\\' in this document.\\n  \\n  (Thanks to Carl Kleinpaste\\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu>, David Clunie\\n  <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> and Johan Helsingius <julf@penet.fi> for\\n  contributions here.)\\n\\n\\n_____\\n<8.5> What is the value of anonymity?\\n\\n  KONDARED@PURCCVM.BITNET:\\n    \\n  > I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the\\n  > content of one\\'s message.

P. A1.\\n\\nNEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE\\n\\n\\t* INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage\\n\\t  by a man who infiltrated political groups\\n\\nBy Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time\\nart dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In\\nreality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and\\namassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40\\nyears.\\n\\nHis code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was\\nso successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen\\nto head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi\\n(D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.\\n\\nFor a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White\\nAryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he\\nobtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. \\nAnd he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government\\nto trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.\\n\\nThese are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former\\nLos Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with\\npolice and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide\\nintelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.\\n\\nOfficials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper\\nactivity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They\\nhave refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.\\n\\nTranscripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents\\nreleased by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details\\nof the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line\\ninto illegal territory.\\n\\nAt times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air\\nwith laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with\\nforeign agents and code names like \"Ironsides\" and \"Flipper.\"\\n\\nOn one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a\\npro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa,\\nIsrael.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties\\nto Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him. \\nShortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed\\nhim.\\n\\nThe court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA\\nagent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing\\nconfidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.\\n\\nGerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by\\nthe FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its\\ncontents included passports, driver\\'s licenses and identification\\ncards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for\\nfour American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank\\nbirth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from\\nvarious agencies.\\n\\nAlso in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a\\nblack hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of\\nblindfolded and chained men.\\n\\nInvestigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the\\nADL confidential driver\\'s license or vehicle registration information\\non a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one\\ntarget group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.\\n\\nEach case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would\\nconstitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in\\nan affidavit for a search warrant.\\n\\nThe Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil\\nrights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on\\ngroups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL\\'s\\nfact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a\\nreputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with\\npolice agencies and journalists. \\n\\nHowever, evidence seized from Bullock\\'s computer shows he kept files\\non at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the\\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United\\nFarm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for\\nInvestigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the\\nAsian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.\\n\\nThe computer files also included information on several members of\\nCongress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman\\nRon Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey\\nfrom the Bay Area.\\n\\nIn their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation\\nLeague has collected information on political activists in the Los\\nAngeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely\\nwith three Los Angeles County sheriff\\'s deputies who specialized in\\nintelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism\\nexpert and a San Diego County Sheriff\\'s Department intelligence\\nofficer.\\n\\nA spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff\\'s Department said he knew\\nnothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los\\nAngeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the\\ninvestigation, and the San Diego Sheriff\\'s Department declined\\ncomment.\\n\\nBullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy\\ndrama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a\\nvolunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a\\nbook about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.\\n\\nBullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by\\nthe ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the\\nmid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations\\nup and down the West Coast.\\n\\nTo keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled\\nthrough Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never\\nmissed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.\\n\\n\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all\\nanti-democratic movements,\" Bullock said.  \". . . Officially, I\\'m only\\na contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not\\nbe officially connected with me.\"\\n\\nBullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists\\nto Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own\\nname but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.\\n\\n\"I\\'m one of a kind,\" he told police.\\n\\nIn recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become\\nknown, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a\\nshotgun who threatened to kill him.\\n\\nIn the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a\\nsynagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and\\nmatching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by\\npolice.  In part because of this investigation, he became close\\nfriends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco\\npolice intelligence division.\\n\\nBullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An\\nFBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:\\n\\n\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and\\nwould share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to\\nGerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to\\nBullock.\"\\n\\nFrom a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876\\nindividuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files\\ncontained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.\\n\\nIn 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of\\ninformation to the South African government.  Bullock tells of\\nmeetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels\\nand receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100\\nbills.\\n\\nBullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled\\nonly from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published\\nby San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African\\nBishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli --\\nand submitted it as his own work.\\n\\nBullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence. \\nBullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government\\nevenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \"I may be gay but I\\'m a\\nstraight arrow.\"\\n\\nIn his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about\\nengaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to\\nviolate the law.\\n\\nFor example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver\\'s license records\\nand criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of\\nthe confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said\\nGerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence\\nfiles on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under\\ndepartment policy.\\n\\nBullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation\\nof Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League\\'s San\\nFrancisco office.\\n\\nBullock seemed proud of his \"Operation Eavesdrop,\" in which he used a\\npaid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan\\nResistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by\\nmembers of the right-wing group.  \"For a short time, it was\\nwonderful,\" he told police.\\n\\nIn Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago\\nas a \"fact-finder\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go\\nundercover to the meetings of target groups.\\n\\nAmong other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles\\nADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \"anti-Israel\\nleanings\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such\\nsentiment.\\n\\nGurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he\\nattempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a\\nrival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for\\nHolocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival\\nand threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate\\ngroup.\\n\\nGurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the\\nprobe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation. \\nUnlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nGurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed\\nby The Times. Bullock\\'s attorney said his client would not comment.\\n--\\nYigal Arens\\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\\narens@isi.edu\\n',\n",

While it doesn\\'t\\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \\n\\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn\\'t changed\\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\\nProbe\\'s suspension doesn\\'t like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \\npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They\\'ll find\\nthat they have no room in the back and you\\'ll find that the car rides\\ndifferently (if that\\'s \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there\\'s a lot of glass\\naround you which I wasn\\'t expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\\nhot in the summer.

Rain is much better:  water \\ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \\nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they\\'re rigid plastic\\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD\\'s max.  The center console/storage bin/arm\\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"\\nbut that\\'s it.  No change holders.

For the sake of brevity, I\\'ll present them in some separate\\n    points.\\n\\n    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of\\n    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the\\n    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:\\n\\n    - It was alleged that:\" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah\\'s technological\\n    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of\\n    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. \"!\\n    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives \\n    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology\\n    in Iran after revolution.\\n\\n    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors\\n    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen\\n    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in\\n    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and\\n    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.\\n\\n    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi\\n    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most\\n    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total\\n    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million\\n    dead left from the war.\\n\\n    - The translation of Iranian officials\\' talks are not 100% true. For\\n    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: \" It hurts me to\\n    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.\" The \\n    translator says: \" It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly \\n    research.\"!\\n\\n    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought\\n    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to \\n    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran\\'s\\n    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in\\n    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.\\n\\n    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of \\n    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the\\n    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed\\n    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account\\n    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its\\n    potential role in improvement of Iran\\'s industries and eventually the\\n    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries\\n    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones\\n    in scientific and industrial efforts.\\n\\n    4- A key point in program\\'s justifications is trying to disvalidate as\\n    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from\\n    Iran\\'s different sites. They say: \"We are not sure if the places visited\\n    by IAEA are the real ones or not\" !, or \" We can not rely on IAEA\\'s\\n    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq\\'s nuclear\\n    activities before\" as if they didn\\'t know that Iraq was trying to build\\n    nuclear weapons!\\n\\n    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the\\n    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,\\n    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking\\n    from the absolute knowledge!\\n\\n       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their\\n    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to\\n    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs\\n    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.\\n\\n\\nMohammad\\n\\n  \\n    [*] International Atomic Energy Agency\\n  \\n',\n",

Bussard, Journal of\\n\\tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\\n\\n\\t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\\n\\t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\\n\\t    thrust-power \"gain\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\\n\\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\\n\\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\\n\\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\\n\\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\\n\\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\\n\\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\\n\\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\\n\\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\\n\\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows\\n\\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\\n\\t    Earth/moon space.\\n\\n\\t\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\\n\\tAerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W.

If plasma\\n\\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\\n\\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\\n\\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\\n\\t    other special applications would be at hand.

Such connotations\\nare quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the\\neightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar\\nMax Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european\\', but then the\\nNazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan\\' is\\nsynonymous with `nordic\\' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who\\noriginally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans\\nand possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word\\nby Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is\\nnontheless inappropriate.

This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual\\n>world.  \\n\\nThis was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who lived\\nimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son\\nNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a\\nstronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of\\nhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on\\nhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.\\n It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and\\nthus he became the \"Elevator of the heavens.\"  This \"god\" made men able to\\n\"feel\" as if heaven were afar off and \"as if either the God of Heaven could not\\nsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of\\nHis laws.\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \"Emancipator\"\\nor \"Deliverer\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system\\nand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many\\nbenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a\\nDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God\\'s wrath, the other\\nactually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it\\nas true.\\n\\n>The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\\n>an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to consign Adam\\n>or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.\\n\\nI don\\'t see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to\\nthe coming \"Anointed One\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who\\nwas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the\\nCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the\\ndispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it\\nas a completed action.  Rom\\'s makes it clear that it has always been salvation\\nvia faith and nothing else.\\n\\n>It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The\\n>relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely\\n>extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. \\n\\nI understand what you\\'re trying to convey, but I don\\'t think I\\'d lay hold of it\\nbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the\\neternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal\\nlife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of\\nconsciousness.  \\n\\n>It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous\\n>were lost. \\n\\nIt depends upon your def of \"lost.\"  The elect were lost only in time as\\noutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. \\nExistentially we were all born \"lost\", but the \"righteous\" were \"in Christ\" and\\ntherefore never *assuredly* lost.  \\n>\\n>It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient\\n>people\\'s ideas of life after death.\\n\\nMaybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.

But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the\\nunderlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as \"mystery\" religions\\nfor no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private\\nside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they\\nrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\\nto light. The \"Mystery of Iniquity\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point\\ntoday might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in\\nEgypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the \"husband son.\")\\n\\n>On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity\\n>that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the\\n>human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is\\n>created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas\\n>dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does\\n>today.\\n\\nNo, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you\\'re alluding to in that the\\nchurch, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their\\nworldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you\\nare a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to\\nexpound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which\\nthey had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and\\ndiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also\\nthe trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson\\'s \"Egyptians.\"  He really\\ndoes a number on what the Greeks did to what they \"pilfered\" from the\\nEgyptians. \\n\\n> He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same\\n>time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our\\n>eternal spiritual being had grown dim.\\n\\nI\\'m not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.  Its just that\\n\"there is nothing new under the sun.\"\\n\\n\\n>Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal\\n>irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.

The early creeds do not spell these things out\\nin detail because, 1) they weren\\'t the topic of concern, 2) there was\\ninsufficient wisdom accumulated, 3) they didn\\'t have the exegetical tools that\\nwe have today.

I think this is going to be a\\ntough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of\\nresources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are\\nserious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate\\nBill 266 in 1991.\\n\\nPossible actions to take in response:\\n\\n1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and\\nmore.\\n\\n2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and\\ntechnology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,\\nwrite some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or\\nnewspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. \\nRemember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be\\nslow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and\\narcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming\\nlibertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. \\n\\n3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your\\nMember of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US\\nSenators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of\\ntechnology issues.  Talk to those aides.\\n\\n4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party\\nwould certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of\\nthe Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a\\nsurprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political\\nspectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other\\nactivist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government\\nthat can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play\\nthemselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you\\nwant to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.\\n\\n4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and\\nComputer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming\\nthese groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal\\nexpenses and lobbying.\\n\\n5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably\\ndevelop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be\\nlobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a\\ntelecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your\\ncoworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then\\npresent your company's management with a united front of engineering\\ntalent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your\\nmanagement, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold\\nmeetings on it.\\n\\n6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla\\ntechno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP,\\nanonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers,\\netc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might\\nalso be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed\\nby Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful\\ntools for these purposes. \\n\\n7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on\\nthis topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we\\nmay have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't\\noutright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of\\nthis Clipper chip plan in the end.
